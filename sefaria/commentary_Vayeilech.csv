31,1,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:1:1,"AND MOSES WENT. When Moses concluded his words, all who stood before him, and the young children, and the women returned to their own tents. It was not necessary for Scripture to mention this [that they returned to their tents], for it already stated, Ye are standing this day all of you before the Eternal your G-d; (Above, 29:9.)  that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d, (Ibid., Verse 11.)  and [it is self-understood that] after having entered the covenant they would go away from him [Moses]. And so Scripture now states that Moses went from the camp of the Levites to the camp of the Israelites in order to show them honor, like someone who wishes to take leave of his friend and comes to ask permission of him."
31,1,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:1:1,"AND MOSES WENT. Moses went to each tribe and tribe to inform them that he was about to die and that they should not fear. (For they would not be left leaderless.)  He strengthened them (He encouraged them.)  with his words to Joshua. (Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this people into the land, etc.,(vs. 7,8).)  Scripture therefore afterwards reads, and thou shalt cause them to inherit it (v. 7). I believe that he then (After charging Joshua in the sight of all of Israel (v. 7).)  blessed the tribes. (While they were assembled together.)  This is so even though the blessings are recorded later. (In Deut. 33.) "

31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:1,"וילך משה, ""Moses went, etc."" We need to know where Moses went. Yonathan ben Uzziel translates that Moses went to the study hall. Other commentators such as Nachmanides and Rabbeynu Bachyah say that he went from the camp of the Levites to the encampment of the Israelites much like a man who takes leave from his friends. The wording of the Torah is vague and does not provide a clue as to where Moses actually went. Another thing we are entitled to know is who told Moses that he would die on that day. Have we not been told in Shabbat 30 that man is not informed of precisely how long he will live? If that is correct, who told Moses that he would die on that day?"
31,1,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:1:1,"וילך משה, he was self-propelled, just as was Amram, Moses’ father who married his aunt Yocheved, daughter of Levi, and almost certainly many years his senior. (Exodus 2,1) Another of many uses of the word וילך meaning that the person described acted of their own initiative is found in Deut. 17,3 where the Jewish idolater described had not been seduced by anyone. After having concluded the matter of the covenant between G’d and this second generation of Israelites many of whom had not been born at the time of the Exodus, Moses now proceeds to comfort the people over his impending death. He does so in order that the joy over G’d having concluded this covenant with them should not be turned into sorrow over the prospect of his impending passing from the scene. Rejoicing over having been found fit to become a party to such a covenant is something natural, the psalmist in Psalms 149,2 speaking of Israel rejoicing with or over its Maker. Being in G’d’s presence, such as here, is always a joyful experience, as is offering sacrifices to Him, as we know from Deut. 27,7.when the occasion was to mark the erecting of the stones after the successful crossing of the river Jordan.

31,1,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 1","Deuteronomy 31,1. “Moses went and spoke all these ‎words to the whole people of Israel.” This verse ‎‎[seeing that the Torah does not tell us from where Moses ‎walked to where, Ed.] may become easier to understand ‎when we consider that our sages, when referring to the man ‎leading the congregation in prayer sometimes refer to him as ‎descending in front of the Ark, whereas on other occasions they ‎describe him as ‎עובר לפני התיבה‎, ”walking past” the front of the ‎Ark. When a tzaddik is engaged in prayer he needs to ‎attach himself to the letters of his prayer, i.e. ‎תיבות‎, [an alternate ‎meaning of ‎תיבה‎,] which in turn gives his prayer guidance and ‎direction as a result of which his prayers focus better on their ‎objective. There are some outstanding tzaddikim who are ‎not in need of this guidance, but on the contrary, give deeper ‎meaning to each of these letters and words. The latter type of ‎‎tzaddik was Moses, who, in the celestial hierarchy ‎represented the Matronita, as we know from the Zohar ‎where Moses is described as the Matronita’s husband in the ‎sense of “dominant companion of this Matronita who is ‎portrayed as a combination of the emanation of malchut ‎and Torah.”  At any rate, the expression ‎יורד לפני התיבה‎, “descending ‎beneath the Ark,” i.e. the word or letter, means receiving one’s ‎spiritual inspiration from above, whereas people leading the ‎congregation in prayer who are being described as ‎עובר לפני התיבה‎, ‎are presumed to be at least on the same spiritual level as the ‎‎“ark,” so that they can inspire the Ark, i.e. words or letters, with ‎some of their holiness. Moses was an individual belonging to this ‎second group of tzaddikim, so much so, that after ‎descending from Mount Sinai with the second set of the Tablets, ‎his forehead exuded so much spiritual light that he had to ‎‎“screen” it as it frightened the people who saw in him a ‎supernatural phenomenon. We have explained repeatedly that ‎the level of his prophecy was such that he saw clear visions ‎whereas other prophets saw only unclear, murky visions. ‎‎(Yevamot 49) This enabled him to relate the words G’d had ‎spoken to him, verbatim, without having to paraphrase them.‎‎ Just as Yaakov lost his prophetic ability when he was about to ‎reveal details of the eventual redemption to his children on his ‎deathbed (Genesis 49,1-2) so Moses’ prophetic pre-eminence was ‎taken away from him shortly before his death, as most of this was ‎transferred to his successor Joshua. This is why his parting “song” ‎האזינו‎, is full of allusions, many of which are difficult to decipher. ‎Our verse above alludes to the process of the transition of Moses’ ‎spiritual powers to Joshua.‎"
31,1,Commentary,"JPS 1985 Footnotes, Deuteronomy 31:1",An ancient Heb. ms. and the Septuagint read: “When Moses had finished speaking …”; cf. 29.1.
31,1,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 1","“And Moshe went and spoke these words ….” (Devarim, 31:1) The verse says specifically “and Moshe went” and “going,” halicha, signifies being disturbed. (Perhaps because when one is disturbed by something he may be inclined to move his place.)  It was difficult for him to understand how man could fix the deficiency imprinted on the root of his soul from the day of his birth passed on from his mother and father, for his mother conceived him in sin. (This phrase is borrowed from Tehilim 51:7. The idea needs investigation. Was he not conceived in the mitzvah of pru u’vru, [be fruitful and multiply]? Yet this is something that is very easily contaminated because of its great holiness. So this statement, especially when someone on the level of David haMelech says it about himself, is quite revealing of the human predicament. It seems here that along with the fixings needed for physical union, he is also talking about everything inherited from our parents that needs fixing.)  However, when the commandment to gather the people was said to him (Devarim, 31:12, “Gather the people, the parents, the children … that they may learn, and fear God”), it was intimated to Moshe that man may fix the sin he is born with, which comes from his root and the root of his parents. Then joy filled his being, as it is written (Yirmiya, 4:1), “If Israel will return … return unto Me.” When a man commits a transgression, God forbid, then in his mind he is ashamed before his friend. Even though his friend does not know about it, he is anyhow uncomfortable because he feels that his friend is better than he is. This is not teshuva shleimah, complete return to the Torah. This is why the prophet said, “you shall return to Me,” meaning that one should rather be ashamed before God so as not to do something that God did not command. God commanded 613 mitzvot, and each one is advice to Israel as to how one may remove the evil desires rooted in his heart, rooted there due to the impurity of mortal existence. This is as it says in the Gemara (Kiddushin, 40b), “[Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tsaddok said: What is a Tsaddik compared to in this world? A tree that exists in a place that is wholly pure,] yet part of it turns to a place of impurity.” So therefore, God gave man advice as to how he may remove himself from desires, such as the mitzvah of tsitsit, which reminds man to have the fear of God, and tefillin, which teaches of the tekifut (unbridled strength) of Kedusha, a notion previously explained (see above, Devarim, 17:13). Yet, in response to the evil attributes that are imprinted in man from the day of his birth derived from the root of his father and mother, as the prophet said (Yesahya, 48:8), “For I knew that you would surely act treacherously, and you were called a sinner from the womb,” we received the section of “gather your people” (Devarim, 31:12). This is as it says in the Gemara (Chagiga, 3a), “Why did the infants also come? To reward those who brought them.” This means, by means of the longing of the father and mother to bring words of Torah into the ears of the infant—even though he does not understand anything at all. An example of this is found in the Talmud Yerushalmi (Yevamot, 1:6), “See who teaches knowledge. Rabbi Yehoshua’s mother would bring him in his cradle into the house of study so that his ears would absorb Words of Torah.” This shows how it is possible to fix even the attributes imprinted in man from his mother’s womb. This longing on the part of the parents is called “serving the Torah is greater than studying it,” for by means of this he may heal what came before. This is “[to reward] those who brought them,” meaning that even the father and mother are also fixed by this, since it fixes what came before, namely the desire of the father and mother at the moment of conception, and then it follows that he was clean regarding his mother. When Moshe Rabeynu understood this, he was filled with simcha (joy)."
31,1,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:1:1","וילך משה, “Moses went, etc.” According to Nachmanides, after the people had accepted the new covenant and had gone to their respective tents, Moses left the encampment of the Levites, where the assembly had taken place, and went to the encampment of the Israelites, to show them respect and to take his final leave of them as on that very day he was to die on Mount Nebo. It is good manners not to take one’s leave without asking his host for permission to absent oneself, and Moses adhered to this time-honoured custom. His parting words commenced with his telling the people that on that day he had attained the age of 120 years. He informed them of this in order to lessen their grief over his passing, suggesting that now that he had attained that age he would no longer be a suitable leader for them. Moreover, seeing that G’d had forbidden him to cross the river Jordan, even if he felt capable and so inclined, he could not continue to lead them.
    Our sages said that the fountains of wisdom from which Moses had drunk during the last forty years had already dried up for him, and he could no longer draw inspiration from them. (Compare Sotah 13) This was actually a miracle G’d performed for him so that he would not grieve over Joshua taking over from him at a time when he still felt perfectly competent to continue.
"
31,1,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:1:3","וילך משה וידבר את הדברים האלה אל כל ישראל. בן מאה ועשרים שנה אנכי היום, וגו', “Moses went and spoke these words to all of Israel. ‘I am 120 years old this day.’” It is possible that the 120 years Moses lived corresponded to the 120 days he spent on Mount Sinai. During the first 40 days he received the first set of Tablets. During the second 40 days he pleaded for G’d to forgive the people the sin of the golden calf; he spent the next 40 days on the mountain in order to receive the second set of Tablets. This may be the reason why he used the term אנכי instead of אני.  Our sages in Sotah 13 feel that he meant to say that on that day he was precisely 120 years old, i.e. that he died on the same day of the same month as he had been born. This may also be the reason why he used the word היום at the beginning of the previous Parshah, so that all these speeches took place on the same day. The day in question was the seventh day of Adar at the end of the Israelites 40th year in the desert. We have further proof of this in 34,8 where the Torah reported that the people mourned Moses for 30 days during which they did not journey. The Torah states explicitly that the days of Moses’ mourning came to an end. It is proper to read this verse in conjunction with Joshua 1,10: “Joshua commanded the law-enforcement officers of the people: ‘prepare for yourselves provisions for in another three days you will cross the river Jordan.’” Anyone reading these two verses together will realize that Joshua would not command the people to prepare these provisions until the mourning period for Moses had passed. To make this plain, the Torah had to write the verse: “the days of crying for (the death of) Moses had concluded.” The Book of Joshua 4,19 reports that the Jewish people completed crossing the river Jordan on the tenth of the first month, i.e. 3 days after the conclusion of the mourning period for Moses. By counting backwards you will arrive at the date of the 7th Adar as the date on which Moses had died. When the Torah in Exodus 2,3 reported that Moses’ mother was unable to hide him any longer, the date referred to is the 6th of Sivan, the day on which the revelation at Mount Sinai took place 80 years later. On that day, the light which filled only his parents’ home on the day he was born became so powerful that it shone for the whole Jewish nation. The light which had filled the house of Amram had already forecast the eventual greatness of the boy that had been born to Yocheved. The reason Yocheved had to hide Moses in a basket, well insulated, was that the light surrounding the baby had become so much stronger that it represented a danger to the family. The Torah speaks of Yocheved having hidden Moses for שלשה ירחים ‘three lunar months,” rather than שלשה חדשים, “three months,” (Exodus 2,2) to indicate that these were lunar months. The months Adar, Nisan, and Iyar are 29,30, and 29 days long, respectively. This gives us a total of 88 days during which Moses was kept “hidden” at home, or it takes us back to the 7th day of Adar as Moses’ birthday. From all this it becomes clear that Moses died on the same day of the same month on which he had been born. The word חדש implies a period which equals 1/12th of the year, something not subject to variation either by adding or subtracting from it. The same is not true of the period known as ירח, a period which may comprise either 29 or 30 days. The reason why the Torah used the term ירחים in the verse mentioned was to enable us to calculate the precise date on which Moses was born. This prompted our sages in Kiddushin 38 to state that G’d completes the life cycle of the righteous from day to day (to grant them whole years) something they base on Exodus 23,26: את מספר ימיך אמלא, “I will fill (round out) the number of your days (meaning “years”)."
31,1,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:1:4","לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבא, “I am no longer able to go out (to war) and to come back.” Moses refers to the times he had led the armies of the Jewish people against Sichon and Og, respectively.  Nachmanides claims that the reason that Moses made this statement was to console the people about his impending death. No doubt, his physical powers had continued undiminished, as the Torah testifies about him in Deut. 34,7. He simply wanted to enhance the people’s regard for Joshua who would henceforth lead them in battle, and ensure that they would inherit the land. Our sages in Sotah 13. understand the words: “to go out and to come back” as referring to words of Torah. They claim that Moses felt that his ability to teach the Torah had waned, that the fountains of wisdom had dried up for him. This by it self was a miracle as it prevented him from relating to his impending death with worry and sadness. G’d also allowed this to happen so that Joshua could take over from him during his lifetime."
31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:2,"I believe we must explain our verse by recalling the Zohar volume one page 217. We are told there that 40 days prior to man's death his נשמה leaves him. Zohar bases this on Song of Songs 4,6: ונסו הצללים, ""and the shadows fled."" These ""shadows"" search for a resting place in the celestial regions and the righteous are aware of this. It is described there that Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai was aware of the fact that Rabbi Yitzchak's soul had already departed from him while the latter was still alive. "
31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:3,"It is also mentioned there that the names of the Israelites are actually the names of their respective souls. I myself have explained this on Proverbs 10,7 ""that the name of the wicked will rot."" Zohar Chadash 120 interprets this to mean that the wicked will not be able to remember his name, the reason being that the wicked has no soul. Having been deprived of his soul it is not surprising that the wicked does not recall his name."
31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:4,"Here we are told that ""Moses went;"" this means that his soul, the spirit of life named Moses, had gone from him just like in any other צדיק whose end is at hand. In this instance Moses' soul is referred to in the masculine gender, i.e. וילך, to stress the greatness of his soul. By writing וידבר את הדברים האלה the Torah indicates that Moses was aware when walking that he would die on that day. He made this plain when he said: ""I am exactly 120 years old today, etc."" Our sages in Rosh Hashanah 11 interpret Moses' words as: ""today my days and years have been completed."""
31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:5,"Having read all this you may ask how it was that Moses knew that he would die on that day and not 40 days later seeing we said that the soul leaves 40 days before one's death? Read what I have written on Genesis 47,29 ""Israel's days to die approached."""
31,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:1:6,"וידבר את הדברים האלה, He spoke these words, etc. Moses wanted to show that though he was 120 years old and about to die he had the strength to say all the words recorded from here until the end of the Book of Deuteronomy. No one except Moses possessed the physical or intellectual strength to do this."
31,1,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 75:7:1,"7. Torah and prayer have two facets, thought and crying out, which correspond to Moshe and David. Crying out is the aspect of “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets” (Proverbs 1:20). Thought is the aspect of “the rounding of your thighs” (Song of Songs 7:2). Of Moshe it is written (Exodus 8:8), “Moshe cried out”; and it is written (Deuteronomy 31:1), “[Moshe] went and he spoke”—i.e., he would assemble congregations in public places. This is the aspect of “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets.” And of David it is written (Psalms 68:27), “Bless God in assemblies,” which likewise is “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets.”"
31,1,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:24:1,"AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED WRITING [THE WORDS OF THIS LAW]. The meaning thereof is that, at first, he wrote the Law and delivered it unto the priests as is stated above, (Above, Verse 9.)  but he did not tell them where they were to put it. Afterwards he was commanded concerning this Song — he wrote it and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  that same day, and thus added it to the Law. And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing everything in the Book of the Law, then he commanded the priests, Take this Book of the Law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d, (Verse 26.)  meaning that it should remain in the ark at the side [of the Tablets], for henceforth they would not even touch it to add [thereto] or to diminish [from it]. This is the sense of the verse, And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing [the words of this Law in a book] until they were completed. Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [Seder] V’zoth Habrachah (Further, Chapter 33.)  was [written] earlier, and its proper place is above as it is stated And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel. (Above, Verse 1. Ibn Ezra holds that at the time when he informed them of his impending death, he also blessed them, as recorded in Seder V’zoth Habrachah.)  It is possible that after he wrote the Song and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  one by one according to their tribes as he had them brought before him to the House of Learning, he wrote it in the Book of the Law and commanded the priests Take this Book of the Law, (Verse 26.)  meaning that the Song too, should remain in the ark with the Law, for it is part of the Law since it is there as a testimony. Then Moses told them to assemble before him again — all the elders of the tribes and the officers (See further, Verse 28.)  — and that the people should join them, for so it is stated at the end, And Moses came and spoke all the words of this Song in the ears of the people. (Further, 32:44.)  Now the priests did so and they assembled the entire people before him and he called heaven and earth to witness against them in assembly (Thus in addition to teaching the Song to the individual tribes, he now taught it again in an assembly of the entire people.)  in the hearing of the priests and all the people. Then G-d, blessed be He, told him Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim. (Ibid., Verse 49.)  This he was bound to do immediately, and so he stood up and blessed them: ‘V’zoth Habrachah’ (And this is the blessing). (Ibid., 33:1.)  He then wrote it at the end of the book which he gave to the priests. Then the priests did as he commanded them — they placed the complete book by the side of the ark of the covenant. (In accordance with Ramban’s interpretation at the beginning of the verse that the Law was placed “in the ark at the side [of the Tablets]” the language here too must mean: “[inside] by the side of the ark of the covenant.” This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir (Baba Bathra 14a).)  Thus everything took place in the order stated in the Torah. (See a similar approach of Ramban in Leviticus 8:2 (Vol. III, p. 91-93).)  Ha’azinu"
31,1,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 9:4","The Sabbatical year does not nullify debts until its conclusion. [This is derived as follows: Deuteronomy 15:1-2] states: ""At the end of seven years, you shall effect a remission. This is the matter of the remission."" And [Deuteronomy 31:10] states: (With regard to the Hakhel ceremony. The interrelation of these verses has its source in the Sifri.)  ""At the end of seven years, at the time of the Sabbatical year, during the holiday of Sukkot."" Just as in that instance, [the event takes place] after the seven [years], so too, the nullification of the debts takes place after the seven [years]. Therefore if one lent money to a colleague in the Sabbatical year itself, he may demand payment of his debt for the entire year. (According to other authorities, although the debt is not remitted until the end of the Sabbatical year, from the beginning of the Sabbatical year, the creditor is forbidden to demand payment. See Shulchan Aruch HaRav, loc. cit. 36.)  When the sun sets on the night of Rosh HaShanah of the eighth year, (I.e., the sunset marking the advent of Rosh HaShanah.)  the debt is nullified. (Because it is forbidden to demand its payment (Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.).) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,13,Halakhah,"From Sinai to Ethiopia, Shulhan haOrit; The Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now, 3 Shabbat 9:5","The Babylonian Talmud notes that the Jews in Eretz Yisrael completed reading the entire Torah in three years, while in Babylonia, they completed it in one year. According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

31,1,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:1:1-2","לכו לחמו בלחמי ושתו ביין מסכתי, “Come and eat my bread, drink the wine which I have mixed.” (Proverbs 9,5.) In this verse Solomon compared the Torah to bread and wine, seeing that bread and wine are the principal sources of food for the body. Similarly, Torah and wisdom are the principal sources of nourishment for the soul. The reason why Solomon commences with the expression לכו, and did not say בואו, “come,” is to teach that a person has to follow wisdom, i.e. go out in search of it and after the people who teach it. We find this verb used in this connection also in Proverbs 13,20: הולך את חכמים יחכם, “he who walks with scholars will himself become wise.” The expression is unusual as we would have expected the author to say: “he who sits with the scholars will become wise.” The only reason that in both instances Solomon used the verb הולך to describe how one is to relate to the scholars in order to benefit from their wisdom is to teach that one has to actively go after the wisdom which comes out of the mouth of the Torah scholars. One needs to denigrate oneself vis-a-vis the scholars; as a result one will absorb wisdom.  It is also possible that the reason for the use of the word לכו by Solomon is a hint that even if one has to travel a long way from one’s home in order to acquire this wisdom one should do so. The message is that it is worth while to travel to distant countries in order to hear and study “My bread,” i.e. Torah. The same thought is echoed by Isaiah 55,3 who quotes the Lord as saying: “incline your ear and come to Me, hearken and you shall be revived.” G’d (The prophet) did not say: בואו אלי, “come to Me,” as man sometimes has to travel to distant places in order to study Torah.  The words לכו לחמו בלחמי, may be perceived as “go to one another those who are anxious to eat of My bread.” it is a warning to remove jealousy and envy from one’s heart and that the scholars should not project an image of superiority which would prevent them from going to colleagues of equal stature. Most certainly they should not be arrogant enough to refrain from going to scholars who are of still greater stature. Wisdom increases through the interchange of ideas among equals. Our sages in Makkot 10 used the verse in Jeremiah 50,36: חרב אל הבדים ונואלו (concerning people who avoid studying in large groups) to illustrate this thought by understanding these words to mean “a sword against the loners!” The prophet condemns the people who want to study in solitary meditation only. Not only do these people not increase their knowledge by doing so, but they are even apt to become foolish, i.e. arrive at faulty conclusions. In the verse quoted from Jeremiah, we have the word נואלו and we have a similar word in Numbers 12,11 i.e. אשר נואלנו, where it means: “we have acted foolishly.” The message is clear.  Concerning the words: “drink from My wine;” the letter ב in the word בלחמי in the first half of the verse appears superfluous. Why then did Solomon write it? Similarly, the letter ב in the word ביין also appears unnecessary. Actually, the letter ב in both instances means the same as in Genesis 41,2 where Ibn Ezra understands the letter ב in ותרענה באחו as not part of the word אחו. I believe that whereas when one drinks wine it is only healthy in diluted form, and damaging if drunk in its full strength, so that the word בלחמי and ביין could be understood as warning not to eat or drink all of the bread and the wine, the word מסכתי, “what I (G’d) have mixed” is to teach that when it comes to Torah and the performance of its commandments, all of them are to be studied and performed in undiluted form.  This simile contains yet another lesson which is worth mentioning. If someone spends a lot of time engaged in the pursuit of his livelihood, i.e. the needs of his body, and travels abroad in order to secure himself such a sound economic existence, even though he should have concentrated the major part of his energies amassing Torah knowledge, i.e. food for his soul, he errs, seeing that when one spends all kinds of energy on the amassing of Torah knowledge a measure of success is guaranteed, whereas the energy spent on the amassing of material wealth does not always result in success. Solomon encourages the pursuit of food for the soul more so than the pursuit of physical food for the body. He makes this plain in Proverbs 2, 4-5: “if you seek it (Torah) as silver, and search for it as for treasures, then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and will find knowledge of G’d.”  Every single commandment may be perceived of as “soul-food;” it provides the kind of nourishment which the soul will imbibe in the future when it is exposed to the brilliance of G’d’s Shechinah in עולם הבא, the world to come. If one is able to perform commandments and good deeds locally, his reward is most certainly substantial; imagine how much more will be his reward if he travels far and wide in order to fulfill some of the commandments of the Torah! The reason is that he also receives a reward for the distance traveled and the effort and fatigue involved. We find proof of this when the eagerness to fulfill a commandment is described by the Torah (Exodus 12,28) as “they went and they did.” Similarly, the Torah describes Moses’ leaving the camp of the Levites in order to go to the camp of the Israelites in these terms. He could have waited for the Israelites to come to him and take leave of him. In fact, although they had all been assembled around him to listen to the rebukes, and he could easily have said his good byes then, he waited till each one of them had returned to his tent, and only then"
31,1,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:1,"Moses went and spoke these aforementioned words, from the beginning of Deuteronomy, to all Israel."
31,1,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 2","“Moses went” [31:1]. Moses went from one gate to the other gate, to the Levites and the Israelites to console them. He said to them: when I will die, yet there is still Joshua who will lead you and will teach you Torah, just as I have taught you. Even though all of Israel stood together, Moses waited until each one had gone to his house, and then Moses went to each one separately, to their house, expecting that he would receive the reward for the trip. (Ramban, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.) "
31,2,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 10:2,"“And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them; After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei” (Deuteronomy 1:3-4). (Guggenheimer notes that this means that all laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given either at the time of consecration of the Tabernacle, or during the second year after the Exodus. He also notes that the remaining 38 years are without record except for the list of stations (Num. 33) and the few remarks in Deuteronomy quoted at the end of this chapter. )  From the first of Shevat until the sixth of Adar, thirty-six days, did Moses our Teacher expound the entire Torah. On the sixth [of Adar] ""And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die..."" (Deuteronomy 31:14). (R. Jacob Emdin asks, if you have a difficulty understanding why Scripture reduced one year from the life of the righteous [Moses], see what he wrote in his Sefer Yaavetz, Section 133, at the end of this chapter. Guggenheimer notes that the computation of the date of Moses's death is quoted at length in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 38a, and in a shortened version, in Tosefta Sotah 11, in both versions of Tanhuma, and in Deut. Rabba, end of Vaethanan, and Sifry Deut. 304.  He notes that according to all sources, Moses died on 7 Adar. He explains that Josephus puts Moses's death on 1 Adar because he simply copied the dates of the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. )  On the seventh of Adar ""And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day..."" (Deuteronomy 31:1-2). Why does Scripture say ""this day""? It says ""this day"" to teach us that on the seventh of Adar was Moses born, and on the seventh of Adar he died, as it is written ""So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated"" (Deuteronomy 34:5-7). (R. Jacob Emdin notes that he explains in his Sefer Yaavetz which day of the week was 7 Adar. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the argument is based on the verses ""an hundred and twenty years old this day"" (Deut. 31:2), and ""And there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the number of your days I will fulfil"" (Ex. 23:26), which mean that the just will complete the full measure of their years.  Guggenheimer notes that the first part of Ex. 23:26 speaks of the general blessing bestowed on Israel and the second part is addressed to Moses personally.)  ""And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan..."" ""And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it"" (Joshua 1:1-2,10-11). ""And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho"" (Joshua 4:19). (Guggenheimer notes that the verse ""Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise"" (Joshua 1:2) means that Joshua should act immediately, on the day following the 30 days of mourning.  He notes that according to this verse, Israel crossed the Jordan on 10 Nisan. Hence, the mourning started on the day of Moses's death, and to compute that day, one has to subtract 32 from 39.)  Count from there thirty-three days backwards, and you will learn that Moses our teacher died on the seventh of Adar.   Three good providers arose for Israel, and these are they: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through them to Israel, and these are they: the well, and the pillar of cloud, and the Mannah. The Mannah was [given] by the merit of Moses, the pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, the well by the merit of Miriam. Miriam died, the well disappeared, it was given back to Israel by the merit of Moses and Aaron. Aaron died, the pillar of cloud disappeared, it was given back to them by the merit of Moses. [Moses died], (R. Eliyahu from Vilna adds ""Moses died"" here.  The bracket is a later addition.)   all three disappeared, and they did not return, as it is written ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" (Zechariah 11:8). Did they die in one month? They died in one year! Miriam died on the tenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is a Tosephta of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, reported in the Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 9a).  Guggenheimer notes that Megilat Taanit, which reports the same tradition, probably also is from the school of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, in contrast to Josephus who puts Miriam's death on the first of Nissan.  R. Jacob Emdin, however, notes that R. Yose the son of R. Judah's opinion is accepted by Yerushalmi sources, such as the Yerushalmi Targum (Pseudo-Jonathan) to Num. 20, and copied from there by the Gaonic Halakhot Gedolot, and the medieval Tur and Shulhan Arukh.)   and Aaron on the first of Av, (R. Jacob Emdin notes that this disagrees with the Talmud, which puts the death of Aaron in Tammuz.  Guggenheimer notes that French manuscripts have ""first of Tammuz.""  He explains that in Seder Olam, Av always has 30 days.)   and Moses our teacher on the seventh of Adar. Rather, on the day that Moses died, all three disappeared and never returned. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that, according to Seder Olam, all three good providers died in different months and the verse ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" does not refer to the month of their death, but to the month in which the Temple was destroyed.  R. Jacob Emdin interprets the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 17a, that the wicked are judged for 12 months in Gehinnom, but that according to R. Yohanan ben Nuri the 12 months are counted from Passover to Shavuot, to mean that R. Yohanan ben Nuri holds that only the three Pilgrimage Festivals have the full status of Shabbatot.  He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.)   From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read ""Shabbat"" instead of ""Sunday"" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement ""on the seventh of Adar they ate..."" refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain"" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.)  as it is written ""And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."" (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say ""And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. ""They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"", (The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets ""yamim"" in ""yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim"" (1 Sam. 27:7) as ""two days and four months"" and not as ""one year and four months"" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads ""four months,"" not ""about four months.""   Guggenheimer explains that the word ""yamim"" in the verse cited here, that usually means ""days,"" must mean ""two days"" since by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" if ""yamim"" meant ""years,"" then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. )  that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is ""39 years"" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 ""years of servitude"" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.)  That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), ""the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."")   which were good for them, like the Mannah.

31,1,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:1:1","וילך משה, “Moses went;” from near the Tabernacle where he had his residence, as we know from: והחונים לפני משכן ה' משה אהרן ובניו, “and the ones encamped in front of the Tent of meeting: Moses, Aaron and his sons.”He now went from each tribe to the next to advise them of his impending death. He assured them that they had nothing to fear from his impending death, but that they should take heart and support their new leader Joshua. Why did Moses feel that he had to address and reassure each tribe separately? Why did he not merely use his trumpets and call a great assembly of the whole nation? According to Rabbi Joshua in the name of Rabbi Levi of Sakkinon, the trumpets which Moses had made in the desert, G-d hid them so that no one, not even he himself, would ever blow them again, as it would have been unseemly to do so on the day when he knew he was going to die. On that day Moses’ control over events had come to an end."
31,2,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:2:1,"AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: ‘I AM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OLD THIS DAY.’ This was to comfort them concerning his condition [i.e., about his approaching death], as if to say, “I am old and you have no more benefit from me. Moreover, G-d has commanded me that I should not go over there. Do not dread and do not be fearful, for the Eternal will go over with you; He will not remove His Presence from you on my account [i.e., because of my absence], and Joshua, he shall go over before (Further, Verse 3.)  you in my place.” Now, although Moses our teacher retained his vigor and health, as Scripture testifies, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated, (Ibid., 34:7.)  he told them this [“I am old and you have no more benefit of me”] in order to comfort them [over the transfer of leadership to Joshua]. Now, Rashi wrote: “I can no longer go out and go in, because the Eternal hath said unto me: Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.” But it is not correct. (The text reads: ‘Vashem’ (‘and’ the Eternal) said unto me. Now, Rashi explains that the connective vav, which generally means “and,” signifies “because.” It is this interpretation which Ramban considers incorrect because vav always means “and,” not “because.” Mizrachi, too, raised this objection to Rashi and left it unanswered. See, however, in Ma’aravi where a different version of Rashi’s text is cited, in which the connective vav has its usual meaning.)  And in the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra the expression I can no longer go out and come in means to war, because his powers weakened in his old age. This too, is not correct. (For Scripture testifies: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated (further, 34:7).)  And our Rabbis have said: (Sotah 13b.)  “This teaches us that the well-springs of wisdom were stopped for him.” This was a miraculous event in order that Moses should not be troubled [about the transfer of leadership to Joshua] and [G-d] bestowing honor upon Joshua in his [Moses’] presence. (See further, Verse 14.) "
31,2,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:2:1,וילך משה וגו' ... אנכי היום AND MOSES WENT ... I AM [HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OLD] THIS DAY — Today my days and my years become full: for on this day (the seventh of Adar; cf. Rashi on Deuteronomy 1:3) I was born and on this day I must die (Sotah 13b).
31,2,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:2:2,"לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבוא I CAN NO LONGER GO OUT AND COME IN — One might think that this was because his physical strength failed him! Scripture, however, states (Deuteronomy 34:7) “His eye was not dim nor his natural force abated!” What then is the meaning of לא אוכל? It means: “I am not permitted” (cf. Rashi on Deuteronomy 12:17 and Deuteronomy 24:4), because the power (leadership) is being taken from me and given to Joshua. — Another explanation of לצאת ולבוא is: I can no more take the lead in the matter of the Law; this teaches us that the traditions and the well-springs of wisdom were stopped up for him (cf. Sotah 13b)."
31,2,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:2:3,"וה' אמר אלי — This (according to the previous comment) is the explanation of לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבוא: I can no more go out and come in because (ו = because) the Lord has said unto Me, [Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan]."
31,2,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:2:1,"GO OUT AND COME IN. In war. (To lead you into battle.)  Even if I did not die now, I would not have the ability to wage war. You have no need for any person to help you, for God will destroy the nations. (I.E.’s paraphrase of the first part of verse 3.)  Joshua will do the same. (I.E.’s interpretation of and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken (v. 3).)  What you saw with your eyes in the war of Sihon and Og is proof. (I.E.’s interpretation of verse 4.) "

"
31,2,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:2:1,"בן מאה ועשרים שנה אנכי היום, Moses mentions his age to remind the people that there is no reason to be sad that someone of his age has to die. According to any life expectancy and law of nature, he was no longer fit to go on living by natural means."
31,2,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:2:2,"לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבא, even if I were still able, I would not be able to function physically as a leader should, such as leading you in he conquest of the Land of Israel as I am suffering from symptoms of old age."
31,2,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:2:3,"וה' אמר אלי לא תעבור, furthermore, G’d had said to me a while ago: “you will not cross;” even if I were physically capable of leading you, the fact that G’d told me that I would not cross the Jordan would have made my leadership pointless. You are therefore better off without me so that you will be able to cross.
"
31,2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:2:1,"לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבא, ""I am no longer able to go out and come in"" (lead you in war). Moses attributed his inability to do so to the fact that he had already lost control over his soul the one which bore his name, as we explained in the name of the Zohar. It had already departed from him."
31,2,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Rosh Hashanah 1:4","R. Joshua, however, says: ""Whence do we know that the Patriarchs were born in the month of Nissan? It is said (I Kings 6, 1) In the fourth year, in the month Ziv (glory), which is the second month, etc.; i.e., in that month in which the glorious ones of the earth (the patriarchs) were born. But, how is the passage of Ethanim to be explained? This means that they (the Israelites) were strongly protected by meritorious deeds. But how will the one who holds that the patriarchs were born in Tishri explain the reference to the month of Ziv? He will explain it literally: In the month when the trees are blooming, as R. Juda said: ""Whoever takes a walk in the month of Nissan and observes the trees sprouting forth, he should say: 'Blessed art thou who hast made thy world lacking in naught, but hast produced therein goodly creatures and goodly trees wherewith to give delight unto the children of men.'"" According to the one who holds that the patriarchs were born in Nissan, they also died in Nissan; and, according to the one who holds that they were born in Tishri, they also died in Tishri; for it is said (Deut. 31, 2) Moses said, I am one hundred and twenty years old to-day. He need not say to-day [if it has no special significance]. We, therefore, infer that to-day implies that just that very day have his days and years been completed. This is to teach that the Holy One, praised be He! grants the righteous the fulfillment of the years of their life to the very month and day; as it is said (Ex. 23, 26) The number of thy days will I make full. "
31,2,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Sotah 1:51","""Who is greater than Moses among all Israel, who was attended at his death by God himself, as it is said (Deut. 34, 6) And He buried him in the land of Moab, opposite, Beth-Pe'or, etc. (Ib. 6, 25) And the Lord said unto us, 'Let it suffice thee.'"" Said R. Levi: With the word Rab did Moses inform others, [of grave tidings.] And with the word Rab he himself was informed [of grave tidings]; i.e., with the word Rab did he inform others, as it is written (Numb. 16, 7) You assume too much [Rab] ye sons of Levi, and he was in turn informed by the word. And the Lord said unto me, '(Rab lack) let it suffice thee:' in another way may Rab be explained, thou hast a Rabbi whose name is Joshua. Still in another way may Rab be explained. Let it suffice to thee so that people should not say, ""How rigorous the teacher [Lord] is and how persistent is the scholar."" And why did the Lord act so rigorously against Moses? In the academy of R. Ishmael it was explained: According to the camel is his load [the greater the man the greater is his responsibility]. (Deut. 31, 2) Moses said unto them: 'I am one hundred and twenty years old today.' He need not say today, [if there is no special significance]. What does he mean by the word to-day? This means that today have my days been completed; from this we may infer that the Holy One, praised be He, grants the righteous the fulfillment of the years of their life to the very month and day, as it is said (Ex. 23, 26) The number of thy days will I make full. (Deut. 31, 2) I am not able any more to go out and come in. What does that mean, to go out and come in? Shall we take it literally? Behold it is written further (Ib. 34, 7) And Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eyes were not dimmed, and his natural strength has not abated, and again it is written (Ib., ib., ib.) And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the Mount of Nebo. Concerning which we are taught in a Baraitha the following explanation: There were twelve stairs to the Mount and Moses surmounted them all in one step. [Hence we see that Moses was healthy and strong up to his death?] Said R. Samuel b. Nachmeni in the name of R. Jonathan: ""To come forth, refers to the discussions of the Torah, from which it may be inferred that the wellsprings of wisdom were shut up for him."" (Ib. 13, 14) Moses and Joshua went and placed themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. We are taught that that particular Sabbath was a Sabbath of Transmittance of office by two. The office was taken irom one (Moses) and given to the other (Joshua). [Hence both served on the same day]. "
31,2,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Kiddushin 1:25","(Fol. 38) It is written (Ex. 16, 35) And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabitated land; the manna they did eat, until they came unto the border of the land of Cana'an. It is impossible to say [that they ate the manna] until they came to an inhabited land (on the other side of the Jordan), since the same passage says They did eat unto the borders of the land of Cana'an (on this side of the Jordan); and again it is impossible to say [that they ate the manna until they came] unto the borders of the land of Cana'an, since the same passage says, until they came, etc. How then could both conecting statements be reconciled? On the seventh of the month of Adar, Moses died, and on that day the manna ceased to come down from heaven [on this side of the Jordan], Israel, however, supplied themselves with manna in vessels which lasted them until the sixteenth of the month of Nisan [until they passed the Jordan]. We are taught in another Baraitha: And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years. Did they indeed eat the manna exactly forty years? Behold they only ate it forty years less thirty days. We must therefore say that the unleavened bread which Israel took along from Egypt had the taste of Manna. We are taught in another Baraitha: On the seventh of the month Adar, Moses died, and on the seventh of the month Adar, he was born. Whence do we learn that he died on the seventh of Adar? It is said (Deut. 34, 5) And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, and it is further written, And the children of Israel wept for Moses; and it is written (Josh. 1, 1) And it came to pass after the death of Moses; and the next passage says (Ib.) Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, pass over, etc.; and again the passage says, Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people; and it is further written (Ib. 4, 79) And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month. Deduct from this date thirty-three days (thirty of the mourning and three for preparing themselves as stated Josh. 1, 11), hence you will find that Moses died on the seventh of Adar. And whence do we know that on the seventh of Adar, Moses was born? The passage says (Deut. 31, 2) Moses said, I am one hundred and twenty years old today. He need not have said today [if it had no special significance]. We therefore infer that today implies that just that very day have his days and years been completed. This is to teach that the Holy One, praised be He, grants the righteous the fulfillment of the years of their life to the very month and day, as it is said (Ex. 23, 26) The number of thy days will I make full.

31,2,Commentary,"JPS 1985 Footnotes, Deuteronomy 31:2",Lit. “come and go.”
31,2,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 2","“… I can no longer go out or come in ….” (Devarim, 31:2) On this day Moshe Rabeynu was completed in the truest form of perfection, and God signed His name to this. All the while one is not complete he may still apprehend more and reach greater heights. Yet he may also, God forbid, lose that which he has already received. After one has reached the state of completion, he will not lose anything he has previously apprehended, nor will he apprehend anything further. This is what Moshe Rabeynu meant when he said “I can no longer go out or come in.” “Going out” means that he was complete and God signed His name on his actions so that it would be impossible to lose what he had apprehended. “Coming in” means that also he would apprehend nothing further."
31,2,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 2:3,"(Devarim 1:3) ""And it was, in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel"": What does this (""in the eleventh month"") come to teach us? If that a year has eleven months, is it not written (Esther 3:13) ""on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar""? And thus is it written (I Kings 4:7) ""And Solomon had twelve commissioners over all of Israel … (Ibid. 19) and one commissioner over the land."" For which month? The intercalated month, whereby we are taught that the year (itself) is twelve months. R. B'na'ah says: Now before Solomon did we not know that the year was twelve months? Is it not written (I Chronicles 1:27) ""… month by month throughout all the months of the year … the twelfth (marshal), for the twelfth month, etc."" — But it (""the eleventh month"") comes to teach us that in thirty-six days (from the first of Shvat [""the eleventh month""] to the sixth of Adar) Moses explained the entire Torah, as it is written (Devarim 34:8) ""And they mourned Moses thirty days"" and (Joshua 1:11) ""for in three more days you will be crossing this Jordan,"" and (Ibid. 4:19) ""And the people ascended from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month (Nissan)."" Subtract thirty-three days retroactively and it is found that Moses died on the seventh of Adar. (And whence is it derived that Moses was born on the seventh of Adar? From (Devarim 31:2) ""And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old this day."" Let ""this day"" not be written. Why is it written? (To signify) this day (the full circuit of) my years and days have been completed — whence it is derived that the Holy One Blessed be He ""sits"" and fills out the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month and from hour to hour, as it is written (Shemoth 23:26) (If you are righteous) ""the number of your days shall I complete."" — whence it is derived that in thirty-six days Moses explained the entire Torah."
31,2,Talmud,Kiddushin 38a:7,"The baraita continues: And from where is it derived that Moses was born on the seventh of Adar? It is as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in” (Deuteronomy 31:2). As there is no need for the verse to state “today,” since Moses could have said simply: I am one hundred and twenty years old. What is the meaning when the verse states “today”? One can learn from it that Moses was born on that date, i.e., he was exactly one hundred and twenty years old. This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill” (Exodus 23:26)."
31,2,Talmud,Rosh Hashanah 11a:12,"The Gemara continues: The one who said that in Nisan the Patriarchs were born also holds that in Nisan they died. The one who says that in Tishrei they were born also holds that in Tishrei they died, as it is stated about Moses on the day of his death: “And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today” (Deuteronomy 31:2). As there is no need for the verse to state “today,” since it is clear that Moses was speaking on that day, what is the meaning when the verse states “today”? It is to teach that Moses was speaking precisely, as if to say: Today my days and years are exactly filled and completed. This comes to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and fills the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill” (Exodus 23:26). Similarly, the Patriarchs merited that their years be fulfilled to the day, and so they died on the same date they were born."
31,2,Talmud,Sotah 13b:16,"The verse relates what Moses said to the Jewish people at the end of his life: “And he said to them: I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no longer go out and come in; and the Lord has said to me: You shall not go over this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 31:2). The wording is problematic, as there is no need for the verse to state the term “this day.” Moses said it in order to indicate: On this day, my days and years have been completed to be precisely one hundred and twenty, in order to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is written: “The number of your days I will fill” (Exodus 23:26), indicating that the righteous will live out their years fully."
31,2,Talmud,Sotah 13b:17,"The verse continues: “I can no longer go out and come in” (Deuteronomy 31:2). The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of “go out and come in”? If we say it means literally that Moses was actually physically restricted from going out and coming in, but isn’t it written: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated” (Deuteronomy 34:7), indicating that he was at full physical strength? And it is written further: “And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo” (Deuteronomy 34:1). And it is taught in a baraita: There were twelve steps there to ascend the mountain, and Moses stepped over them all in one step, also indicating that he was at full physical strength."
31,2,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vaetchanan 6:1","(Deut. 3:26), “Do not [ever] speak [unto me on this matter] again.]” This is related to what Job said (in Job 20:6-7), “Even though one's height ascends to the heavens, [and his head reaches the clouds]. He perishes forever, like his dung….” With reference to whom did Job say this verse? It only speaks with reference to the day of death. So even though one ascends to the heavens and makes himself wings like a bird; when his time to die arrives, his wings are broken, and he falls before the angel of death like an animal before the butcher. So also has David said (in Ps. 146:4), “His spirit departs; he returns to the ground.” And Job has already stated (in Job 3:19), “The small and the great are there, and the slave ('eved) is free from his master.” As even if his master bought him for thousands and thousands of gold coins, once [the slave’s] time to die has come, he cannot say, “He is my slave,” but rather he becomes free from his master. Another interpretation (of Job 20:6), “Even though one's height ascends to the heavens.” This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and who came to the Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with Him (i.e., with the Holy One, blessed be He,) face to face and received the Torah from His hand. When his time to die arrived, He said to him (in Deut. 31:14), “Behold the days are drawing near for you to die.” [Moses] said to Him, “Master of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before Your children like a horse, that my end be for the worm? R. Abbahu said, “To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said, ‘This is suitable only for the king.’ What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift. (Gk.: doron.)  The king said, ‘Cut off his head with it.’ So also Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘By the word that I [used to] praise (Rt.: KLS. Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  you, when I said (in Deut. 10:14), “Behold (hen), the heavens [and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it] belong to the Lord your God!’ By that [very] word (i.e., hen) You are decreeing death over me, when you say (in Deut. 31:14), “Behold (hen), the days are drawing near for you to die.”’” (Below, Deut. 11:6.)  He said to him, “Moses, I have already decreed (Rt.: QLS. Cf. Lat.: census; Gk.: kensos.)  death over the first Adam.” He said to him, “My master, the first Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. Hence it is fitting for him to die. [God] said to him, “Consider Abraham, [who] sanctified My name in My world [but still died].” He said to him, “Master of the world, From Abraham there came out Ishmael, whose race provoked You to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) ‘The tents of robbers prosper, [and those who provoke God have security, the ones whom God brought forth in His hand].’” He said to him, “Consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar.” He said to him, “From Isaac there came out Esau, who in the future will destroy the Temple and burn Your sanctuary.” He said to him, “Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes without any flaw.” He said to him “Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he was not like the ministering angels, he did not receive Torah from Your hand and he did not speak with you face to face.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Deut. 3:26), “Enough from you; do not [ever] speak [unto Me on this matter] again.” He said to Him, “Perhaps [future] generations will say, ‘If He had not found bad things in Moses, He would not have removed him from the world.” He said to him, “I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10), “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.” He said in front of Him, “The people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age.” He said to him, “I have already written (in Deut. 32:51), “Because you acted faithlessly with me.” (Cf. Numb. 20:12.)  He said to Him, “Please let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years there, and after that let me die.” He said to him (in Deut. 32:52), “And there you shall not go.” He said to Him, “If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death.” He said to him, “Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead.” He said in front of Him, “Why all this anger against me?” He said to him (according to Deut. 32:51), “Because you did not sanctify Me.” He said to him, “With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29), ‘Behold, God does all these things two or three times to a man’; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. First you said, (in Exod. 4:13) ‘Please make someone else your agent’; secondly (in Exod. 5:23), ‘For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, [he has dealt worse with this people, and You have still not delivered Your people]’; thirdly (in Numb. 11:22) ‘If the sheep and cattle would be slaughtered for them , would it be [enough] for them’; fourthly (in Numb. 16:29), ‘The Lord did not send me’; fifthly (in Numb. 20:10), ‘Listen, you rebels, [shall we bring forth water for you from this rock]’; (See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.)  sixth (in Numb. 32:14), ‘And now you brood of sinners have arisen in place of your ancestors.’ But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children?” He said to Him, “I have learned so from You, when you said (in Numb. 17:3), ‘The censers of these who have sinned [at the cost of their lives].’ He said to him, “I said (ibid.), ‘At the cost of their lives,’ and not, ‘at the cost of their ancestors.’” He said in front of Him, “I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before You a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, You forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads [because of me], yet You are not taking care of me.” He said to him, “Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now [the] time was delivered into your hands, but from now [the] time is not delivered into your hands.” He said to Him, “Master of the universe, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which You shall bring on my body. So do not deliver me to the pangs of the angel of death. Moreover, if You do this, I will proclaim Your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17), ‘I shall not die, but live [and recount the works of the Lord].’” He said to him (in vs. 20), “This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall come through it.” [From this it follows that] death has been ordained from time immemorial for the righteous and for all mortals. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to the heaven and earth, where he said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “Before seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6), ‘for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment.’” (See ‘AZ 17a, for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.)  He went to the stars and planets. He said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “Before seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 34:4), ‘All the host of heaven shall rot away….’” He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “[Before seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10), ‘For the mountains shall move, and the hills shall be shaken.’” (The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical translations but fits the sense of the midrash.)  He went to the Great Sea. He said to it, “Seek mercy for me.” [The sea] said to him, “Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of [other] days? Are you not the son of Amram, who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12), ‘Who had His glorious arm walk at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them […].’ So what has happened to you today?” When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2), “’O that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me!’ When I passed through you, I was a world king; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me.” Immediately he betook himself to the arch[angel] of the [Divine] Presence and said to him, “Seek mercy for me, that I not die.” He said to him, “My master, Moses, why the exertion? This is what I have heard from behind the curtain: (Pargod. Cf. Lat.: paragauda or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: Paragaudes (a garment with a purple border).)  That your prayer is not heard on this matter.” Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said, “With whom shall I seek mercy for myself?” R. Simlay said, “At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26), ‘But the Lord was angry with me […],’ until Moses began by uttering this Scripture (Exod. 34:6): ‘Then the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “the Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger…].’” Immediately the holy spirit was cooled off.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed.” He said before Him, “You are coming to me with a plot. You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed.” He said to him, “Master of the Universe, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from Your hands lick the dust? Woe! (Vay.)  All mortals will say, “If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with Him face to face, and received Torah from His hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, blessed be He, how much the worse it will be for [mere] flesh and blood, who comes with no [merit from] Torah and with no [merit from the] commandments?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Why all this anguish that you are experiencing?” He said, “Master of the world, I am afraid of the pangs of the angel of death.” He said to him, “I am not delivering you into his hands.” He said in front of Him, “Master of the universe, my mother Jochebed, who was distressed (literally, whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be distressed by my death.” He said to him, “So has it come up in [My] mind, and so is it the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators, (Gk.: pronoi (“prudent ones”).)  every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve in front of Me, but now your lot is over and the time of your disciple Joshua for him to serve [Me] has arrived.” He said to him, “My Master, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple!” He said to him, “If you want to do that, go and do it.” Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door. (Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.)  Now Joshua was seated expounding [Torah], so Moses stopped to bend his stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself to death. When Israel came to Moses' door to study Torah, they asked and said, “Where did Moshe our master [go]?” [Others] said to them, “He got up early and went to the door of Joshua.” [So] they went and found him at the door of Joshua, with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua, “What has come over you that Moses our master stands, while you sit?” When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said, “O my master, my master! My father, my father and lord!” Israel said to Moses, “Moses our master, teach us Torah.” He said to them, “I am not allowed.” They said to him, “We are not leaving you.” A heavenly voice (bat qol) came forth and said to them, “Learn from Joshua.” [So] they took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with [Elazar and Ithamar] to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said that R. Johanan said, “When Joshua opened by saying, ‘Blessed be the One who has chosen the righteous,” they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose [from the session], they said to Moses, “[Explain] the Torah [we have just heard] to us.” He said to them, “I do not know what to answer you.” So Moses our master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said, “Master of the universe, up to now I requested life, but now here is my soul given over to You.” Then when he had resigned himself to death, the Holy One, blessed be He, opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16), “’Who will stand for Me (In context, the word, me, here is self-referential to the author of Psalms, and not referring to God.)  against evildoers?’ Who will stand for Israel in the time of My wrath? Who will stand in the battle of My children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before Me?” At that time Metatron (Lat.: metator (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).)  came and fell on his face. He said to Him, “Master of the world, [as] in Moses' life he belonged to You, so in his death he belongs to You.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day, his father was angry with him and sought to kill him because he did not maintain respect for the father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. His servants said to him, ‘Our lord king, why are you weeping?’ He said to them, ‘It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, did she rescue him from my hand?’” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Metatron, “It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered Me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before Me to turn back My anger from destroying them.” They came and said to Moses, “The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said to them, “Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them.” He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said, “The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world.” He said to Israel, “I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me.” They said to him, “Our lord master, you are forgiven.” Israel also arose before him and said to him, “O Moses our master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us.” He said to them, “You are forgiven.” They came and said to him, “The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said, “Blessed be the name of the One who lives and abides forever.” He said to Israel, “If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones, and you shall say, ‘Woe (oy) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness.’” They came and said to him, “The half moment has arrived.” He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel, “See the final end of flesh and blood.” They answered and said, “The hands which received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall to the grave.” At that moment his soul departed with a kiss (from the Holy One, blessed be He), (See MQ 28a.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5), “Then Moses [the servant of the Lord] died there [in the Land of Moab at the command of the Lord (literally, by the mouth of the Lord)].” (BB 17a; ARN, A 12:2; Cant. R. 1:2:5; Petirat Mosheh Rabbenu, recension A, in A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853-57), vol. I, p. 129; ibid., recension B, in Jellinek, vol. VI, p. 77.)  Now [the ones who] took care of his burial were neither Israel nor the angels but the Holy One, blessed be He, [Himself], as stated (in vs. 6), “Then He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) buried him (Moses) in the valley [in the Land of Moab].” And for what reason was he buried outside the land? So that those who die when outside the land might live [again] through his merit, (The translation here follows the traditional Tanhuma. Deut. 2:6. So also Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34. The Buber text omits “might live again” and reads “through their merit.”)  as stated (in Deut. 33:21), “He has chosen the best for himself, [for there is an honored lawgiver's portion].” But when did Moses our master die? On the seventh of Adar, (Seder ‘Olam Rabbah, 10; TSot. 11:7; Qid. 38a; see Meg. 13b; Sot. 12b.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5), “Then Moses the servant of the Lord died there [in the Land of Moab].” It is also written (in vs. 8), “And the children of Israel mourned Moses [on the Plains of Moab for thirty days.]” And it is written (in Josh. 1:1), “And it came to pass after the death of Moses, [the servant of the Lord, the Lord spoke unto Joshua]”; (Josh. 4:19) “Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month (i.e., Nisan).” Reckon back thirty-three days [from then]. Ergo, he died on the seventh of Adar. And where is it shown that he was born on the seventh of Adar? Where it is stated (in Deut. 31:2), “He said to them, ‘I am one hundred twenty years old today.’” (Since Moses spoke these words on the day of his death, his birthday must have been the same as the day of his death.)  What is the text teaching with, “today?” Today, I have fulfilled my days and any years. [It is there] to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He, fulfills the years for the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as stated (in Exod. 23:26), “I will fulfill the number of your days.”"
31,2,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vaetchanan 6:2","(Job 20:6): EVEN THOUGH ONE'S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS. This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and whose feet trod on Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from his hand. When his time to die arrived, he said to him (in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE.  said to him: Sovereign of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before your children like a horse? Is my end the worm and the maggot? R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said: This is suitable only for the king. What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift. (Gk.: doron.)  The king said: Cut off his head with it. So also Moses said to the Holy One: By the word that I  praise (Rt.: KLS. Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  you, when I said (in Deut. 10:14): BEHOLD (hen),  BELONG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD! by that  word (i.e., hen) you are decreeing death over me, when you say (in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD (hen), THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU . (Below, Deut. 11:6.)  He said to him: I have already decreed (Rt.: QLS. Cf. Lat.: census; Gk.: kensos.)  death over the first Adam. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, [the first] Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. But I should not die. He said to him: Consider Abraham, who sanctified my name in the world but  died. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, consider  out of him there came Ishmael, whose race provoked you to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY, THE ONES WHOM GOD BROUGHT FORTH IN HIS HAND. He said to him: consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar. He said to him: Out of him there came Esau the Wicked, who destroyed your sanctuary and burned your temple. He said to him: Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes. He said to him Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he did not receive Torah from your hand, and he did not speak with you face to face. The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 3:26): ENOUGH FROM YOU! DO NOT  SPEAK  AGAIN. He said to him: Perhaps  generations will say: If he had not found evil things in Moses, he would not have removed him from the world. He said to him: I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10): NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, perhaps [the people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age. He said to him: I have already written (in Deut. 32:51): [BECAUSE YOU ACTED FAITHLESSLY WITH ME] , BECAUSE YOU DID NOT SANCTIFY ME . (Cf. Numb. 20:12.)  He said to him: If you are willing, let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years [there], and after that let me die. He said to him: It is an irrevocable decision from me. He said to him: If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death. He said to him: Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, why all this anger against me? (According to Deut. 32:51) BECAUSE HE DID NOT SANCTIFY ME. He said to him: With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29): BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A MAN; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me. The Holy One said to him: See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. (1) In the first place you said (in Exod. 4:13) PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT. (2, in Exod. 5:23:) FOR EVER SINCE I CAME TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME, [HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE, AND YOU HAVE STILL NOT DELIVERED YOUR PEOPLE]. (3, In Numb. 16:29:) THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME. (4, In Numb. 16:30:) BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW. (5, In Numb. 20:10:) LISTEN, YOU REBELS, ? (See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.)  (6, Numb:32:14:) AND NOW YOU BROOD OF SINNERS HAVE ARISEN IN PLACE OF YOUR ANCESTORS. But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children? He said to him: I have learned so from you, when you said (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): THE CENSERS OF  WHO HAVE SINNED . He said to him: I said (ibid.): AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES, and not: ""At the cost of their ancestors."" He said to him: Sovereign of the World: I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before you a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, you forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads because of me, yet you are not taking care of me. He said to him: Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now time was delivered into your hands, but now time is not delivered into your hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which you have brought on my body. So do not deliver me into the bonds of the angel of death. Moreover, if you do this, I will proclaim your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17–18): I SHALL NOT DIE, BUT LIVE AND RECOUNT THE WORKS OF THE LORD.  He said to him (in vs. 20): THIS IS THE GATE OF THE LORD; [THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL COME THROUGH IT.] From this it follows that for the righteous and for all mortals death has been ordained from time immemorial. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to heaven and earth, where he said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6): FOR THE HEAVENS SHALL VANISH LIKE SMOKE, AND THE EARTH SHALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT. (See ‘AZ a for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.)  He went to the sun and the moon. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 24:23): THEN THE MOON SHALL BE ASHAMED, AND THE SUN SHALL BE ABASHED. He went to the stars and planets. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: [Instead of us seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, [since it is stated] (in Is. 34:4): ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN SHALL ROT AWAY [….] He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: We should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10): FOR THE MOUNTAINS SHALL MOVE, AND THE HILLS SHALL BE SHAKEN. (The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical versions but fits the sense of the midrash.)  He went to the Great Sea. He said to it: [Seek mercy for me. The sea] said to him: Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of  days? Are you not the son of Amram?  who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12): WHO HAD  WALK AT THE RIGHT HAND OF MOSES, …. So now what has happened to you? When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2): O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, ! When I stood by you, I was a king in the world; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me. Immediately he betook himself to the Arch of the  Presence and said to him: Seek mercy for me, that I not die. He said to him: My Master, Moses, why is this a problem? This is what I have heard from behind the Curtain: (Pargod. Cf. Lat.: paragauda or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: Paragaudes (a garment with a purple border).)  that your prayer has not been heard on this matter. Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said: With whom shall I seek mercy for myself? R. Simlay said: At that time the Holy One was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26): BUT THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME, until Moses began by uttering this scripture: (Exod. 34:6:) [THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE HIM AND PROCLAIMED:] THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, …. Immediately the Holy Spirit cooled him off. The Holy One said to Moses: Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, are you coming to me with a plot? You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from your hand lick the dust? Woe (Vay.)  to all mortals. They will say: If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with him face to face, and received Torah from his hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, how much the worse it will be for  flesh and blood, who comes with no Torah and with no commandments? The Holy One said to Moses: Why all this sorrow over which you are sorrowing? He said: Sovereign of the World, I am afraid of the bonds of the angel of death. He said to him: I am not delivering you into his hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, my mother [Jochebed], who was put to shame (literally: whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be put to shame by my death. He said to him: This has come to mind, but this is the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators, (Gk.: pronoi (“prudent ones”).)  every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve , [but now the lot of your disciple Joshua has arrived for him to serve ]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple! He said to him: If you want to do that, go and do it. Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door. (Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.)  Now Joshua was seated expounding , so Moses stopped to bend his proud stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself [to death]. When Israel came to Moses' door, they found him at the door of Joshua with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua: What has come over you that Moses our Master stands, while you sit? When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said: O my Master, my Master! My Father, my Father and Lord! Israel said to Moses: Moses our Master, teach us Torah. He said to them: I have no authority. They said to him: We are not leaving you. A heavenly voice (bat qol) came forth and said to them: Learn from Joshua. They took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with Eleazar and Ithamar to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Johanan said: When Joshua opened by saying: Blessed be the one who has chosen the righteous and their Mishnaic teaching, they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose , they said to Moses: Close off the Torah for us. He said to them: I do not know what to answer you. So Moses our Master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said: Sovereign of the World, up to now I wanted to live, but now here is my soul given over to you.. Then when he had resigned his soul to death, the Holy One opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16): WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS? Who will stand for Israel in the time of my wrath? Who will stand in the battle of my children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before me? At that time Metatron (Lat.: metator (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).)  came and fell on his face. He said to him: Sovereign of the World,  in Moses' life he belonged to you, so in his death he belongs to you. The Holy One said to him: Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day his father was angry with him and sought to kill him, because he did not maintain respect for his father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. Her servants said to him: Our Lord King, why are you weeping? He said to them: It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, she rescued him from my hand. So also did the Holy One say to Metatron: It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before me [to turn back my anger from destroying them]. They came and said to Moses: The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said to them: Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them. He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said: The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world. He said to Israel: I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me. They said to him: Our Lord Master, you are forgiven. Israel also arose before him and said to him: O Moses our Master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us. He said to them: You are forgiven. They came and said to him: The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said: Blessed be the name of the one who lives and abides forever. He said to Israel: If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones. They said: Woe (oy) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness. They came and said to him: The half moment has arrived. He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel: See the final end of flesh and blood. My two hands with which I received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall in the grave. At that moment his breath departed with a kiss (from the Holy One), (See MQ 28a.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5): THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE . (BB 17a; ARN, A 12:2; Cant. R. 1:2:5; Petirat Mosheh Rabbenu, recension A, in A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853-57), vol. I, p. 129; ibid., recension B, in Jellinek, vol. VI, p. 77.)  Now  took care of his burial were neither Israel nor any of the angels but the Holy One , as stated (in vs. 6): THEN HE (THE HOLY ONE) BURIED HIM (MOSES) IN THE VALLEY …. And for what reason was he buried outside the land? So that those who die when outside the land might live again through his merit, (The translation here follows the traditional Tanhuma. Deut. 2:6. So also Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34. The Buber text omits “might live again” and reads “through their merit.”)  as stated (in Deut. 33:21): HE HAS CHOSEN THE BEST FOR HIMSELF, . But when did Moses our Master die? On the seventh of Adar, (Seder ‘Olam Rabbah, 10; TSot. 11:7; Qid. 38a; see Meg. 13b; Sot. 12b.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5): THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE …. It is also written (in vs. 8): AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MOURNED MOSES ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB FOR THIRTY DAYS. And it is written (in Josh. 1:1–2): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF MOSES, THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, : MOSES MY SERVANT IS DEAD. (Josh. 4:19:) NOW THE PEOPLE CAME UP FROM THE JORDAN ON THE TENTH DAY OF {THIS} [THE FIRST] MONTH (i.e., Nisan). Reckon back from those thirty-three days. Ergo, he died on the seventh of Adar. And where is it shown that he was born on the seventh of Adar? Where it is stated (in Deut. 31:2): HE SAID TO THEM: I AM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS OLD TODAY. (Since Moses spoke these words on the day of his death, his birthday must have been the same as the day of his death.)  What is the significance of TODAY?  to teach you that the Holy One fulfills the years for the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as stated (in Exod. 23:26): I WILL FULFILL THE NUMBER OF YOUR DAYS."
31,2,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Genesis 27:9:1","One ... his Paschal offering and one ... as delicious food... You might ask: How does Rashi know it was Pesach? It seems the answer is: Yitzchok was born on Pesach, as Rashi explains in Parshas Vayeira (18:10). And Hashem completes the days of the righteous — they die on the same day they were born. This is as it says about Moshe (Devarim 31:2): “Today I am one hundred and twenty years old,” and Rashi explains: “Today, my days became complete. On this day I was born, and on this day I will die.” Since Yitzchok said (v. 2), “I do not know the day of my death,” i.e., perhaps I will die today, it must have been Pesach. (Maharshal)"
31,2,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Numbers 27:13:3","Your time would not yet have arrived… You might ask: Surely in this Parshah it is not written על אשר לא קדשתם [""because you did not sanctify""]. The answer is that according to the other interpretation where Rashi explained that ""You are no better than he” it implies that just as Aharon died though his time had not yet arrived, so too Moshe would die even though his time had not yet arrived. However, where do we find that he died before his time? Rashi answers that regarding the death of Moshe it is written, “Because you did not sanctify…” (Devarim 32:51). The other interpretation is necessary because according to the first reason there is the difficulty that Moshe’s death was not like that of Aharon, for in his lifetime Aharon saw that his position of leadership had been passed to his children, however this was not so regarding Moshe, therefore Rashi brings the other interpretation. But, according to other interpretation there is the difficulty that that the phrase כאשר מת אהרן [""just as Aharon died""] implies that Aharon died before his time had come, but this is not explicitly said regarding Aharon. Therefore, the first reason is also necessary. (Gur Aryeh) Though it is stated in the first Perek of Rosh Hashanah (11a): “I am one hundred and twenty years of age today” (Devarim 31:2), why does the Torah say “today”? Rather, [it means]: “Today I am completing my days and my years” teaching that Hashem sits and completes the years of the righteous, from day to day and from month to month. The answer is that it is certainly true that he completed his [natural] years, however he should have lived [longer] due to his righteousness, since the fear of Hashem adds to one's years. However, now that he had sinned he was left with this natural lifespan and nothing was added."
31,2,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:2:1","This explains I cannot any longer, etc. It is as if he said, Because Hashem has said to me, ‘You will not cross over [the Yardein], etc. Yehoshua will cross.’ But it is not because his strength had weakened, for it is written, His appearance was not dulled and his freshness did not fade [Devarim 34:7]. For one cannot say, for Hashem is [a phrase] on its own, as if it had said, I am no longer able, and furthermore, for Hashem said to me, because the meaning of I am no longer able is I have no permission, if so that is the meaning of that the Holy One, Blessed Is He said to me do not cross. Therefore [Rashi] explains that for Hashem said is an explanation. As if to say, I am no longer able because Hashem said, etc. The [letter] vav [meaning and] of And Hashem means because, as in [the verse] And there was no man (Bereishis 2:5) which means Because there was no man. "
31,2,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:2:2","This teaches that he was sealed off from the masoretic teachings, etc. The reason is so that he should not be upset that the greatness was taken from him and given to Yehoshua. For once the traditions of wisdom were blocked from him, why would [he wish to continue to] live? If you ask: Why does Rashi switch [the verse] and first explain I cannot any longer go forth and return and afterward he explains I am today [One hundred and twenty years old] which is not in the order [written] in the verse? And another question: This another interpretation should have been said immediately, before I am today. One can answer in the manner of pilpul: I cannot any longer go forth and return, ‘perhaps, etc.’ until ‘for Hashem has said to me, etc.’ And Rashi asks on this: If you were to ask, that the midrash says that Today my days [and years are completed], etc., which implies that if not for this reason For Hashem said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! And he answers, Really, etc. as I explained. And what you asked, that the Midrash says Today my days [and years] were completed, etc. which implies that without this reason of For Hashem has said to me, etc. he would not have been able to go forth and return! One can answer that the Midrash explains to go forth and return in a different manner, [as Rashi himself explains in the] alternative answer: To go forth and return, “with respect to words of Torah, etc.” [in the name of Maharitz]. According to the alternative answer one must explain For Hashem has said [to me], etc. according to its plain meaning, that Hashem said. [Re”m]

31,2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:2:2,"He also wanted to explain to the people why he was convinced that he would die on that day. While we have already supplied the reason for this, it is not in the nature of the righteous to let on to their peers that they have some superior perceptions; this would be arrogant. This is why Moses cited two different reasons. 1) I am unable to lead you in war, i.e. I no longer have G'd's permission to do so. This permission has now been given Joshua. 2) G'd has told me: ""you will not cross this river Jordan."" From these two indicators it was clear to him that he had outlived his usefulness and was about to die. "
31,2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:2:3,The letter ו before the word השם is to be understood as the reason for the word היום Moses had used immediately before.
31,2,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:2:4,"The sequence of the words וה׳ אמר אלי, ""and the Lord had said to me, etc."" which follow so closely on Moses' statement: I cannot go out, etc."" indicate his loyalty as a servant of the Creator. He suggested by this sequence that if, per chance, this same G'd would now give him instructions to cross the Jordan, he, Moses, would gird himself and be ready to lead the Israelites across though he did not feel capable of doing so at this moment. The only reason he did not insist on doing so was that G'd had told him not to."
31,2,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Vaetchanan, Torah Ohr 30","When G–d said to Moses: רב לך אל תוסף דבר, this amounted to the rejection of Moses' prayers not to be saddled with such problems as the סוד העיבור. Originally Moses had been the ""father of all the prophets."" When G–d said: רב לך, He indicated that in subsequent generations [if Moses were to go on living Ed.] he would need to consult other Torah scholars, i.e. רב לך since his own intellectual powers would decline. We have a hint of this in Isaiah 40,14. Even in Moses' own lifetime the Torah has him say לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבא (Deut. 31,2) ""I no longer can master the intricacies of Torah studies"" (Sotah 13b). He did not refer to his physical prowess, since the Torah itself (Deut. 34,7) testifies that לא נס לחה that Moses had not lost any of his physical vitality. On occasion he had to draw on the memory or resourcefulness of Joshua. This is another meaning of the words רב לך, i.e. ""you already have another teacher."" There is also a hint of the entire development of Moses' prophecy, his rise and decline, in Deut. 18,18: נביא אקים להם מקרב אחיהם כמוך, ""I will raise up a prophet for them from their own people like yourself."" The respective first letters in the opening three words of this verse form the acronym אלם, silent, dumb, suggesting that at the beginning of his prophetic career Moses was silent and the entire input was G–d's. Later on, prophetic utterances would flow from him directly, i.e. מקרב. Still later he would rise to an even higher level when G–d would command him and speak with him publicly. "
31,2,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Megillah 13b:15:3,"And he was born on the seventh of Adar: As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:2), ""A hundred and twenty years old am I today"" - today completed my days and my years. The birth is worthy to atone for the death."
31,2,Tosefta,Tosefta Sotah 11:3,"And from where is it derived that Moses was born on the 7th of Adar? As it is said (Deut. 31:2), ""And he said to them, I am 120 years old today,"" As there is [apparently] no need for the verse to state ""today"" (i.e., it could simply have said, ""I am 120 years old""), what does ""today"" come to teach? That ""today,"" his years became complete. Another version: What does ""today"" come to teach? It teaches that 120 years are precisely calculated from day to day. Another version, what does ""today"" come to teach? That the Holy One Blessed be He fulfills that which he gives to the righteous with goodwill and with happiness, as it is said (Ex. 23:26), ""The number of your days I will complete."" And from where is it derived that Moses died on the 7th of Adar? As it is said (Ex. 34:8), ""And the Children of Israel wept over Moses in the Plains of Moab for thirty days, etc."" And (Josh. 1:1), ""And it was after the death of Moses, the servant of God, etc."" And (Josh. 1:2) ""Now arise and cross [the Jordan]."" And (Josh. 1:10-11) ""Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people, Pass through the camp [and instruct the people ... to be prepare to cross the Jordan in three days]."" And it says (Josh. 4:19), ""And the people arose from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, etc."" Count backwards 33 [days] from that point (i.e., the 10th of Nissan), and it comes out that Moses died on the 7th of Adar."
31,2,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov, Rosh Hashanah 1:8","(4) R. Joshua, however, says: ""Whence do we know that the Patriarchs were born in the month of Nissan? It is said (I Kings 6, 1) In the fourth year, in the month Ziv (glory), which is the second month, etc.; i.e., in that month in which the glorious ones of the earth (the patriarchs) were born. But, how is the passage of Ethanim to be explained? This means that they (the Israelites) were strongly protected by meritorious deeds. But how will the one who holds that the patriarchs were born in Tishri explain the reference to the month of Ziv? He will explain it literally: In the month when the trees are blooming, as R. Juda said: ""Whoever takes a walk in the month of Nissan and observes the trees sprouting forth, he should say: 'Blessed art thou who hast made thy world lacking in naught, but hast produced therein goodly creatures and goodly trees wherewith to give delight unto the children of men.'"" According to the one who holds that the patriarchs were born in Nissan, they also died in Nissan; and, according to the one who holds that they were born in Tishri, they also died in Tishri; for it is said (Deut. 31, 2) Moses said, I am one hundred and twenty years old to-day. He need not say to-day [if it has no special significance]. We, therefore, infer that to-day implies that just that very day have his days and years been completed. This is to teach that the Holy One, praised be He! grants the righteous the fulfillment of the years of their life to the very month and day; as it is said (Ex. 23, 26) The number of thy days will I make full. (5) Isaac was born on Passover. Whence do we infer this? It is written (Gen. 18, 14) At the next festival I will return to thee, and Sarah will have a son. What festival was it when he said this? Shall I assume that it was Passover, that he referred to Pentecost? Is it possible to bear children after fifty days' gestation? If I assume that it was Pentecost, that he referred to Tishri, then again the question is, Who bears children after five months' gestation? Shall I assume that it was Tabernacles, and that he referred to Passover, the same objection may be made: Is it possible to bear children after: six months of gestation? We have been taught in a Baraitha [in answer to the last objection]; that particular year was a leap year [and, therefore, it makes seven months]. But at all events the objection remains, for we must deduct the days of menstruation; hence less than seven months will remain. Mar Zutra [in answer to this] said that although a child born after nine months' gestation is never born before the ninth month is completed, nevertheless a seven months' child can he born before the seventh month is complete; as it is said (I Sam. 1, 20) And it came to pass, Li't'kufoth Hayamim (when the time was come about); the minimum of T'kufoth are two and the minimum of yamim is also two (i.e., after six months and two days' gestation, child-birth is possible). (6) Whence do we know that Sarah, Rachel and Hannah were visited on New Year's Day? R. Elazar said: We infer by comparing the expression, Zechiro, Zechiro (remember) and Pekidah Pekidah (visit) that appear in both places. Concerning the expression Zechira Zechira (remember), it is written of Rachel (Gen. 30, 32) And God remembered (Voyizkor) Rachel; and of Hannah, it is written (I Sam. 1, 19) And God remembered her (Voyizkor); this institutes an analogy between the word remember (Zechira) used in these passages and Zechiro, used in connection with New Year's Day, which is written (Lev. 23, 24) A remembrance (Zichrow) of blowing of cornets. Again, we make an inference from the analogy of Pekido Pekido (visit); it is written concerning Sarah (Gen. 21, 1) And the Lord visited (Pakad) Sarah as He said. Again, it is written concerning Hannah (I Sam. 2, 21) And truly the Lord visited (Pokad) Hannah. By the rule of analogy, all these events took place on the same [New Year's] day. Whence do we know that Joseph was released from prison on New Year's Day? It is written (Ps. 81, 4-5) Blow on the new moon the cornet at the appointed time on the day of our feast; for this is a statute for Israel. And again (Ib.) As a testimony in Joseph did he ordain it, when he went out over the land of Egypt. (Ib. b) On New Year's Day the bondage of our fathers in Egypt ceased. Whence do we know this? We infer it by rule of analogy of the word Sebila mentioned in two places. It is written (Ex. 6, 6) I will bring you out from under the burdens (Sibloth) of the Egyptians; and it is written (Ps. 81, 6) I removed his shoulder from the burden (Seibel); i.e., from the burden of Egypt on the day spoken of in the Psalm. In Nissan they were redeemed, as previously proven. In Tisari we shall again be redeemed. This he deduces by analogy from the word Shofor (cornet), found in the following passages. It is written (Ib.) Blow the cornet on the new moon (i.e., on New Year's Day); and it is written there (Isa. 27, 13) And on that day the great cornet (B'shofor), shall be blown [just as in the former case it means New Year's Day, so does it also in the latter]. R. Joshua says: ""In Nissan they [our ancestors] were redeemed, and in Nissan we shall be redeemed in the future."" Whence do we infer this? From the following passage (Ex. 12, 42), … this same night is a night of watching unto the Lord; i.e., a night specially designated from the first days of creation for the final redemption of Israel. (Ib.) … For all the children of Israel throughout their generations; i.e., a night looked forward to for the future redemption. "
31,2,Chasidut,"Likutei Halakhot, Orach Chaim, Laws of Phylacteries 5:36:1","And this is (Ex. 1), “And it came to pass, when the midwives feared God, and He made them houses.” This is the aspect of the housings of the tefillin. For the midwives are the aspect of the children's mother, drawing the light of tefillin, which are the aspect of mother, upon the son, who are the aspect of giving birth to the brains, the aspect of (ibid. 13), “Sanctify to Me all the male firstborns, whatsoever opens any womb” as mentioned. And this is, “And it happened, when they feared” specifically. For tefillin are the aspect of fear, as written, “And all the people of the land shall see that Hashem's name is called upon you, and they will fear you.” And our Rabbis z”l explained these are the head tefillin. For the midwives are the mother of Aharon and Moshe. And Miriam their sister was the second midwife, from whom royalty issued, as Rashi explained there. For Moshe and Aharon are the essence of the tefillin. Aharon the Kohen Gadol is the aspect of the Eight Tiqunei Diqna of the Kohen Gadol, which are the aspect of the eight elders, the aspect of the eight head and arm tefillin passages as mentioned. Moshe Rabbeinu is the aspect of the Supernal Elder, who boasted that he is extremely old and yet is young and suckling entirely etc. and the whole world does not amount to him so much as an eyeblink etc. This is the aspect of Moshe Rabbeinu a”h who is the aspect of (ibid. 2), “And behold, a crying youth,” that even tough he reach what he reached, the perfect aspect of the Elder in Holiness, still he was entirely in the aspect of youth and suckling, in the aspect of (Ps. 37), “I have been young and also old,” that even though I have become so much an elder, still I am entirely young and suckling, which this is the aspect of the boasting of the foremost level elder who is the Blind One as mentioned. And therefore Moshe attained that it was written of him (Deut. 34), “His eye was not dim and his natural force was not abated” — even after death. For no oldness jumped upon him at all, even when dying at 120 years age. For he attained the ultimate elderliness, yet remained entirely suckling, as if he still had not begin living at all, as written (ibid. 3:24), “You have begun to show” etc.; that is, he still did not grasp at all; Hashem Yithbarakh only began showing him his greatness etc. Which, all this is the above aspect, always beginning anew as mentioned. For Moshe is the aspect of “MaN/Manna,” as is known, of which it says (Ex. 17:15), “For they did not know MaH/what it is.” It is impossible to at all know what he is, that someone born of a woman should attain what he attained. And this is the letters of MoSheH being Shin MaH — Shin, the three fathers who are the entirety of the brains, entirety of the tefillin; but everything is drawn from the aspect of MaH, the aspect of, “For they did not know what it is,” which this is the essence of the aspect of Moshe, who is the aspect of the aforementioned elder, who was elder and suckling etc. as mentioned, who is the root of everything and above everything as mentioned. As written (Num. 12), “And the man, Moshe, was extremely humble” etc., which is the aspect of (Ps. 131), “Like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child,” which David said. And this is that it is written in the Zohar, regarding Moshe, that amongst the Sabas/Supernal Elders he is the Elder, and amongst the sucklings he is the suckling, that is, as mentioned, that he is old and suckling etc. as mentioned. And this is his saying (Deut. 31), “I am one hundred and twenty years old today” — today my days and years are filled, for he can longer go, as our Rabbis z”l said (Sotah 13b), “this teaches that [the gates of wisdom] were closed to him. For he needed to live the aforementioned long life, going each time further and further, and when he cannot go further he was forced to pass away, as discerned in the holy talks of Rabbeinu z”l. And therefore (ibid. 34), “And no man knew his burial-chamber,” for they did not know what he is, as mentioned. Hence Moshe is the aspect of the aforementioned Supernal Elder, who is the root of tefillin, which are the aspect of the face's skin beaming, which Moshe attain, which are the aspect of the light of tefillin, as Rabbeinu z”l said in the torah, “Markevoth Par`oh..” (LM #38), from the aspect of that Elder. And Aharon is the aspect of the eight Tiqunei Diqna, which are the aspect of the eight tefillin passages that are drawn from Moshe's aspect, from the aspect of that Elder. And this is, “And He made them houses” — houses of priesthood and royalty (Sh”R 1). Houses of priesthood are the aspect of tefillin, which are the aspect of the priesthood's sanctity as mentioned, the aspect of the sanctity of the firstborn, to give him to the Kohen as mentioned. And houses of royalty are the aspect of kingship of David Mashiach, the aspect of Emunah, which all this is the aspect of tefillin as mentioned. And the essence of tefillin's sanctity is the aspect of grasping Godliness, which the true tzaddiqim, who are from the aspect of Moshe, draw upon us, through many constrictions, which this is the main thing, that they manage to attain such a high and enormous perception, that they can constrict and clothe the perception in many constrictions and vestments until we too can manage to grasp Godliness as mentioned. And this is the aspect of tefillin housings, for it is impossible for us to receive the light of the passages themselves except by way of the housings and straps, which are the aspect of limitations and vessels of `Olam haTiqun, to receive the light by degree and measure. For they are able to enter the aspect of the “Empty Space"" and reveal His Godliness there, and thereby make holy vessels. For the essence of these vessels' genesis is by means of repair of the Empty Space which is the beginning of the limitation, which is the root of all the vessels and masks generated from the coarsening of the light and its becoming distant from the Emanator. For if there was no Empty Space then the coarsening of the light and its distancing would be irrelevant etc., as explained and discerned in the Writings. Hence the essence of the vessels' genesis derives from the aspect of the Empty Space. But by means of Adam haRishon's failure he was seized in his vessels, the essence of which is in the aspect of the skin, which is the ultimate vessel, the exterior of the exterior; and that is where he was seized the most as mentioned, which this is the aspect of the “Serpent's bite,” from whence is the grip of all the Qelipoth/Husks, God forbid. And therefore the main repair is by means of purifying and processing the hide in sanctity, which is the aspect of repair of the imagination, repair of the Empty Space, which the aforementioned great Tzaddiqim attain repairing, to the point that from it, specifically, they make the aspect of holy vessels to receive the light in degree and measure. Which, this is the aspect of the hide of a pure beast, insofar as the essence of writing the Torah and tefillin is on the hide specifically, and as mentioned. And this is the aspect of the housings made of hide. For we need to receive the light through limitations and vessels that are made by the repair of the Empty Space which is the aspect of repairing the imagination, which is the aspect of hide, as mentioned. And this is the aspect of (Gen. 3), “And Hashem-God made Adam and his wife garments of skin and clothed them” — garments of skin specifically, for the main repair is repairing the skin etc. as mentioned. For, the garments of skin are the aspect of Tallith and Tefillin, which come from skin and from the hair that grows on the skin, as explained in the Etz Chayim. Which, this is the aspect of (Ex. 22:26), “ki hu kesutho levaddah/for that is his only covering” — this is tzitzith; “hi simlatho le`oro/it is his garment for his skin” — this is tefillin (Tiqqunim #69), which are more internal and lofty than tzitzith, as written there. And all this is the aspect of repair of the imagination, which is repair of the Empty Space, as the essence of the repair is by means of Emunah as mentioned. And this is, “And it came to pass, as the midwives feared God” — feared specifically. For holy piety is the aspect of repair of the constriction and stricture of the Empty Space, which is sweetened at it root by means of holy piety, which is the aspect of a “holy decree,” as is known. Therefore by the aspect of piety are made housings, which are the aspect of fixing the vessels and limitations to receive the tefillin's light by degree and measure as mentioned. And this is, “And it came to pass, as they feared... [God] made them housings” as mentioned."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,13,Halakhah,"From Sinai to Ethiopia, Shulhan haOrit; The Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now, 3 Shabbat 9:5","The Babylonian Talmud notes that the Jews in Eretz Yisrael completed reading the entire Torah in three years, while in Babylonia, they completed it in one year. According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

Obgleich Kap. 34, 7 es von Mosche heißt, daß לא כהתה עינו ולא נס לחה, daß trotz seines hundertundzwanzigjährigen Alters seine Kräfte nicht abgenommen hatten, so war dies doch nur eine besondere Gnadenverleihung Gottes für die Zeit seiner Wirksamkeit. Da diese aber geschlossen sein sollte, so durfte er fernerhin nur die seinem Alter entsprechende natürliche Schwäche erwarten, und war ganz berechtigt zu sagen, daß er sich nicht zu beklagen habe, wenn er, der Hundertundzwanzigjährige, nicht mehr auf die Kraft zu einer öffentlichen Wirksamkeit rechnen dürfe. וד׳ אמר אלי וגו׳.

31,2,Midrash,Midrash Tannaim on Deuteronomy 1:3:4,"These are the words that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and did not Moses speak to all of Israel? Rather, these words alone; from where do we learn that all the words in the Torah, the light and the heavy, the intentional and the unintentional, the general and the specific, the main laws and the details, are to be included? The verse states, ""Which Moses spoke, as the Lord commanded him to them."" And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month of the sabbatical year, [Ommision: teaching that the year has twelve months. And what does it teach us, ""And it came to pass in the fortieth year""? Since it says (Esther 3:13), ""In the thirtieth year, in the twelfth month, it is the month of Adar,"" and it says (1 Kings 4:7), ""And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel,"" and it says (ibid. 4:19), ""And the officer who was in the land, this was the month of the passing."" Rabbi Baniya says, ""And did we not know that the year has twelve months until Solomon stood up? And has it not already been said (Deuteronomy 31:2), 'And he said to them, ""I am one hundred and twenty years old today,""' that there is no teaching 'today' except from time to time, teaching that on that day he completed from time to time, and it says (Joshua 1:11), 'Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ""In another three days,""' and it says (ibid. 4:19), 'And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month.' Go out and count thirty-three; what were they doing? Rather, they were mourning for Moses for thirty days, and they entered on the day after the three days, as it says, 'In another three days,' thirty-three in total, and you find that the year has twelve months, for Moses died on the seventh of Adar, and he was born on the seventh of Adar. If so, what does it teach us, 'And it came to pass in the fortieth year'? Rather, it teaches that Moses did not rebuke Israel except close to his death.]"
31,2,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:2,"He said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today. It is possible that Moses turned one hundred and twenty on the very day that he passed away. I will no longer be able to go and come, to lead the people, go before them to war, and deal with all their needs in an organized manner. And yet the reason for this is not weakness, fatigue, or old age, but because the Lord said to me: You shall not cross this Jordan. You, the children of Israel, are getting ready to cross the Jordan River, whereas I am prohibited from entering the Land of Israel."
31,2,Quoting Commentary,"Essays in Ethics; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Vayelekh; Torah as Song 2","Moses’ long and tempestuous career is about to end. With words of blessing and encouragement, he hands on the mantle of ­leadership to his successor Joshua, saying, “I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I may no longer go out and come in, since the Lord has said to me, ‘You will not cross this Jordan’” (Deut. 31:2). As Rashi notes, he says, “I may not,” not “I cannot.” He is still in full bodily vigour, “his eye…undimmed and his natural energy unabated” (34:7). But he has reached the end of his personal road. The time has come for another age, a new generation, and a different kind of leader."
31,2,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 3","“I am now one hundred and twenty years old” [31:2]. Moses lived for one hundred and twenty years, which was related to the three times that he was on Mount Sinai for forty days each time, and three times forty is one hundred and twenty. The first time he received the first Tablets and Israel made the Golden Calf. Moses broke the Tablets, and again went up the mountain and prayed that the Holy One should forgive them for the sin of the Golden Calf. The third forty days Moses received the second Tablets. Therefore, Moses was worthy to live one hundred and twenty years, or three times forty. Moses was born on the seventh of Adar and died on the seventh day of the month of Adar, since the Holy One makes full the days of the righteous, as the verse says, “I will let you enjoy the full count of your days” [Exodus, 23:26]. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.) "
31,2,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 4","“I can no longer come and go” [31:2]. Moses said: I can no longer go to war, and even though his strength was as in his youth, but Moses was consoling Israel. That is to say, do not mourn my death. I am no longer strong enough to go to war for you. Moses said all this so they should not worry, since Joshua would be a better leader than I. Our sages said: Moses said, I cannot go before you. That is, I can no longer teach you Torah. Moses was comparable to the intellect of the Torah. They asked him and he could not answer. The Holy One did this so that Moses should not mourn his death. Since he had lost his intellect, it was despicable for him to live. Another reason is that he forgot the Torah, expecting that Joshua should be better able to answer the Israelites about the Torah. Thus, they will see that Joshua was more worthy to be a leader. Moses previously wrote the whole Torah for Israel. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:1–2.) "
31,2,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 10:2,"“And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them; After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei” (Deuteronomy 1:3-4). (Guggenheimer notes that this means that all laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given either at the time of consecration of the Tabernacle, or during the second year after the Exodus. He also notes that the remaining 38 years are without record except for the list of stations (Num. 33) and the few remarks in Deuteronomy quoted at the end of this chapter. )  From the first of Shevat until the sixth of Adar, thirty-six days, did Moses our Teacher expound the entire Torah. On the sixth [of Adar] ""And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die..."" (Deuteronomy 31:14). (R. Jacob Emdin asks, if you have a difficulty understanding why Scripture reduced one year from the life of the righteous [Moses], see what he wrote in his Sefer Yaavetz, Section 133, at the end of this chapter. Guggenheimer notes that the computation of the date of Moses's death is quoted at length in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 38a, and in a shortened version, in Tosefta Sotah 11, in both versions of Tanhuma, and in Deut. Rabba, end of Vaethanan, and Sifry Deut. 304.  He notes that according to all sources, Moses died on 7 Adar. He explains that Josephus puts Moses's death on 1 Adar because he simply copied the dates of the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. )  On the seventh of Adar ""And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day..."" (Deuteronomy 31:1-2). Why does Scripture say ""this day""? It says ""this day"" to teach us that on the seventh of Adar was Moses born, and on the seventh of Adar he died, as it is written ""So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated"" (Deuteronomy 34:5-7). (R. Jacob Emdin notes that he explains in his Sefer Yaavetz which day of the week was 7 Adar. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the argument is based on the verses ""an hundred and twenty years old this day"" (Deut. 31:2), and ""And there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the number of your days I will fulfil"" (Ex. 23:26), which mean that the just will complete the full measure of their years.  Guggenheimer notes that the first part of Ex. 23:26 speaks of the general blessing bestowed on Israel and the second part is addressed to Moses personally.)  ""And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan..."" ""And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it"" (Joshua 1:1-2,10-11). ""And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho"" (Joshua 4:19). (Guggenheimer notes that the verse ""Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise"" (Joshua 1:2) means that Joshua should act immediately, on the day following the 30 days of mourning.  He notes that according to this verse, Israel crossed the Jordan on 10 Nisan. Hence, the mourning started on the day of Moses's death, and to compute that day, one has to subtract 32 from 39.)  Count from there thirty-three days backwards, and you will learn that Moses our teacher died on the seventh of Adar.   Three good providers arose for Israel, and these are they: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through them to Israel, and these are they: the well, and the pillar of cloud, and the Mannah. The Mannah was [given] by the merit of Moses, the pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, the well by the merit of Miriam. Miriam died, the well disappeared, it was given back to Israel by the merit of Moses and Aaron. Aaron died, the pillar of cloud disappeared, it was given back to them by the merit of Moses. [Moses died], (R. Eliyahu from Vilna adds ""Moses died"" here.  The bracket is a later addition.)   all three disappeared, and they did not return, as it is written ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" (Zechariah 11:8). Did they die in one month? They died in one year! Miriam died on the tenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is a Tosephta of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, reported in the Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 9a).  Guggenheimer notes that Megilat Taanit, which reports the same tradition, probably also is from the school of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, in contrast to Josephus who puts Miriam's death on the first of Nissan.  R. Jacob Emdin, however, notes that R. Yose the son of R. Judah's opinion is accepted by Yerushalmi sources, such as the Yerushalmi Targum (Pseudo-Jonathan) to Num. 20, and copied from there by the Gaonic Halakhot Gedolot, and the medieval Tur and Shulhan Arukh.)   and Aaron on the first of Av, (R. Jacob Emdin notes that this disagrees with the Talmud, which puts the death of Aaron in Tammuz.  Guggenheimer notes that French manuscripts have ""first of Tammuz.""  He explains that in Seder Olam, Av always has 30 days.)   and Moses our teacher on the seventh of Adar. Rather, on the day that Moses died, all three disappeared and never returned. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that, according to Seder Olam, all three good providers died in different months and the verse ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" does not refer to the month of their death, but to the month in which the Temple was destroyed.  R. Jacob Emdin interprets the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 17a, that the wicked are judged for 12 months in Gehinnom, but that according to R. Yohanan ben Nuri the 12 months are counted from Passover to Shavuot, to mean that R. Yohanan ben Nuri holds that only the three Pilgrimage Festivals have the full status of Shabbatot.  He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.)   From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read ""Shabbat"" instead of ""Sunday"" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement ""on the seventh of Adar they ate..."" refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain"" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.)  as it is written ""And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."" (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say ""And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. ""They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"", (The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets ""yamim"" in ""yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim"" (1 Sam. 27:7) as ""two days and four months"" and not as ""one year and four months"" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads ""four months,"" not ""about four months.""   Guggenheimer explains that the word ""yamim"" in the verse cited here, that usually means ""days,"" must mean ""two days"" since by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" if ""yamim"" meant ""years,"" then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. )  that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is ""39 years"" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 ""years of servitude"" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.)  That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), ""the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."")   which were good for them, like the Mannah.

He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.)   From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read ""Shabbat"" instead of ""Sunday"" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement ""on the seventh of Adar they ate..."" refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain"" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.)  as it is written ""And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."" (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say ""And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. ""They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"", (The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets ""yamim"" in ""yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim"" (1 Sam. 27:7) as ""two days and four months"" and not as ""one year and four months"" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads ""four months,"" not ""about four months.""   Guggenheimer explains that the word ""yamim"" in the verse cited here, that usually means ""days,"" must mean ""two days"" since by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" if ""yamim"" meant ""years,"" then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. )  that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is ""39 years"" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 ""years of servitude"" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.)  That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), ""the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."")   which were good for them, like the Mannah.

He summons his successor Joshua and, in the presence of the people, gives him words of encouragement. He instructs the people to gather every seven years to hear a public reading of the Torah. God appears to Moses and Joshua, warning them that the Israelites may eventually stray from the covenant. He instructs them to write down the Torah and teach it to the people, as permanent testimony of the covenant itself. He then encourages Joshua, assuring him that He will be with him as he leads the people."

Secondly, Moses had defeated the two mighty kings Sichon and Og. They would therefore be concerned who would take Moses' place should the need arise."
31,3,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Genesis 46:1:1,"AND HE OFFERED SACRIFICES UNTO THE G-D OF HIS FATHER ISAAC. The duty of honoring one’s father is more imperative than that of honoring one’s grandfather. Therefore the sacrifices are associated with the name of Isaac, and not with that of Abraham. Thus the language of Rashi. But this is not sufficient, for it would have been proper for Scripture to say, “and he offered sacrifices unto the G-d of his fathers,” without singling out any one person, just as Jacob said, The G-d before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk; (Further 48:15.)  and in his prayer he said, O G-d of my father Abraham, and G-d of my father Isaac. (Above, 32:10.)  Or Scripture should have said, “and he offered sacrifices to the Eternal,” just as it says in the case of Abraham, And he built there an altar unto the Eternal. (Ibid., 12:7.)  And what need was there to explain it further? However, this verse contains a secret, which the Rabbis revealed to us there in Bereshith Rabbah: (94:5.)  When Jacob was about to go down to Egypt he saw that the exile was beginning for him and his children, and he feared it, and so he offered many sacrifices to the Fear of his father Isaac (Above, 31:53.)  in order that Divine judgment should not be aimed against him. This he did in Beer-sheba which was a place of prayer for his father, and from there he had taken permission when he went to Haran. (See Ramban above, 28:17.)  Now Scripture uses the word z’vachim, [a term connoting peace-offerings], to inform us that they were not burnt-offerings as were his fathers’, as Abraham offered burnt-offerings. Our Rabbis have said (Zebachim 116a.)  that Noachides (See Note 148 in Seder Vayishlach, also Note 222 in Seder Bereshith.)  did not offer peace-offerings; they offered burnt-offerings. And concerning Noah it is clearly written, And he offered burnt-offerings on the altar. (Above 8:20.)  But on account of his fear of the Eternal, Jacob offered peace-offerings in order to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him, even as the Rabbis have expounded: (Torath Kohanim Vayikra 16:1.)  “They are called sh’lamim (peace-offerings) because they bring shalom (peace) into the world.” Now his original intent was directed at the Divine attribute of power, this being nearest to Isaac. This is the explanation of that which the Rabbis mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah, (94:5.)  i.e., that the duty of honoring one’s father is more imperative than that of honoring one’s grandfather. This explanation applies to that which the Rabbis have said there in yet another form: “First you greet the pupil and afterward you greet the Rabbi.” (The case refers to a procession of a Rabbi and his pupils on the road. Since the pupils travel in advance of the Rabbi, a person coming from the opposite direction would first meet the pupils and then the Rabbi. Similarly, Isaac is the pupil and Abraham is the Rabbi. Hence Jacob offered sacrifices to the G-d of his father Isaac.)  I have seen this text in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah: (Sefer Habahir, 135. See Note 42 in Seder Bereshith.)  “And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. (Above, 31:53.)  Is there any one who swears by the belief of the Fear of his father? However, it was because Jacob was not yet given strength, and so he swore by the power given to his father, as it is said, And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. (Above, 31:53.)  And what is this? It is this concerning which Scripture writes, Then the fire of the Eternal fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, (I Kings 18:38.)  and it is further written, For the Eternal thy G-d is a devouring fire, etc.” (Deuteronomy 4:24.)  Thus far the Midrash. From the words of the Rabbis of this Midrash, we learn that it was for this reason that it does not say here, “and he offered sacrifices to the Eternal,” [but instead it says, “to the G-d of his father Isaac],” because now in Beer-sheba Jacob had already become privileged to possess his own portion [and needed only to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him], (The words in the brackets are from the Commentary of Lvush to the Rekanati on the Torah, who quotes these words of Ramban.)  as it is said, Thou wilt give truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. (Micah 7:20.)  It was therefore necessary to explain it now. Thus by the merit of the sacrifices, the G-d of his father Isaac appeared to him in the visions of the night (Verse 2 here.)  with an ameliorated Divine attribute of justice. It is this which Scripture says concerning them, in the visions of the night, complementing that which He said, I am G-d, the G-d of thy father, (Verse 3 here.)  for He is the G-d of Beth-el Who said to him in Haran, I am the G-d of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar; (Above, 31:13.)  it is He Who is the G-d of thy father. This is the Name and this is the attribute. And He assured him that he should have no fear in Egypt for he will be found righteous in Divine judgment, and he will be redeemed after the affliction. This is the meaning of the Divine promise, And I will also surely bring thee up again. (Verse 4 here.)  Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has written in the twenty-seventh chapter of the first part of the Moreh Nebuchim (Guide of the Perplexed) concerning Onkelos’ translation of the verse, I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, (Verse 4 here.)  [which Onkelos rendered here literally]: “I will go down with thee…and I will bring thee up.” And the Rabbi was amazed at the opinion of Onkelos, [namely, that the literal translation should be used], saying that Onkelos had exerted all his effort to remove any implication of G-d’s corporeality from all narratives in the Torah. Accordingly, in the case of any expression found in the Torah implying any mode of motion that refers to G-d, Onkelos ascribed the action to a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, or a manifestation of Divine Providence. Thus he translated And G-d came down (Exodus 19:20.)  as “and G-d manifested Himself;” I will go down now and see (Above, 18:21.)  as “I will manifest Myself now and see.” And if so, why did Onkelos here translate literally, “I will go down”? And so the Rabbi explained that since Scripture said at the outset of the matter, And G-d spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, (Verse 2 here.)  thus indicating that it is an account of what Jacob was told and not what actually took place, Onkelos therefore did not hesitate to literally translate the words as they were addressed to Jacob in the visions of the night, for the words in question represent an account of what Jacob was told, not what actually took place. There is thus a great difference between a communication transmitted in a dream or a vision of the night, or a communication designated as having been made in a vision or manifestation, and a communication given clearly, [not in a dream, such as communications introduced by phrases like these]: “And the word of the Eternal came unto me, saying,” or “And the Eternal spoke unto me, saying.” These are the words of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon. Similarly he said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 48.)  that Onkelos never translated expressions of “hearing” literally [when the Scriptural references were to G-d], but instead explained them as expressing that a certain matter reached the Creator, or that He accepted a prayer. Thus Onkelos translated the Eternal heard (Above, 29:33.)  as “it was heard before the Eternal;” he translated the verse, I will surely hear his crying (Exodus 22:22.)  as “I will surely accept his complaint.” But if the matter is as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said, why does Onkelos shun literal translations of expressions of movement, and also avoid literal expressions of hearing due to his fear that they might indicate corporeality, but he does not in any place shy away from literally expressing “saying,” “speaking” or “calling,” whether the communication was in a dream or manifestation or overt speech, for in every case he translates: “and G-d said,” “G-d spoke,” “and G-d called unto Moses”? These expressions likewise signify corporeality, and Onkelos should have translated, “and it was said from before G-d,” or “and the glory of G-d said,” or “and G-d willed,” as is appropriate in each case, just as the Rabbi has explained (Moreh Nebuchim I, 65.)  with reference to the terms “speaking” and “saying” when they refer to G-d. And why did Onkelos avoid literal translation in the case of “hearing” and did not do so with respect to “seeing,” which he translated as: “and the Eternal saw”? (Above, 6:5.)  And that which the Rabbi has said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 48.)  that “seeing” indicates mental perception as well as the sensation of sight, this applies all the more to “hearing” for it is employed in many places to indicate mental perception and will, such as: And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai; (Above 16:2.)  Hear the voice of my supplications; (Psalms 28:2.)  Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; (Isaiah 1:15.)  And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d. (Deuteronomy 28:1.)  And so also, leiv shomei’ah (I Kings 3:9.)  (literally: a hearing heart, an understanding heart), and so also in the case of most of [the verses cited by Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon]. So Onkelos should not have been apprehensive of expressions of “hearing” as they only indicate acceptance of a matter by G-d and His being pleased with it, for he does not avoid literal translations of expressions of sight any place, but translates it literally in all cases even when seeing alone is involved. However, where a matter is not conceived by sight alone, but requires attention and discernment, Onkelos renders it as befits the subject. For example, when Scripture says, Because the Eternal hath looked upon my affliction, (Above, 29:32.)  [Onkelos rendered it as, “because my affliction is manifested before the Eternal”]. The verse, I have surely seen the affliction of My people, (Exodus 3:7.)  [was rendered by Onkelos as, “the enslavement of my people is manifest before me,” and the verse], And G-d saw the children of Israel, (Ibid., 2:25.)  [he rendered as, “and the enslavement of the children of Israel was manifest before G-d],” since His seeing them was not just as a matter of perceiving their bodies but of His attention to their situation and His knowledge thereof. This is Onkelos’ method throughout the Torah, and not as the Rabbi’s opinion would have it, as a consquence of which opinion he had to declare [our version of Targum Onkelos] erroneous (Ramban refers here to Chapter 48 of the first part of the Moreh Nebuchim mentioned above, in which Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam) sets forth the theory that Onkelos always renders “seeing” literally except where it is connected with wrong, injury or violence, in which cases he expresses it as “It was manifest before the Eternal.” Onkelos is thus consistent with the prophetic phrase, Thou canst not look on iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). However, Rambam mentions that he found three passages which contradict his theory. One is the verse, And the Eternal saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, (above, 6:5), and the other two are mentioned in the following note. In these three cases which are connected with wrong and violence, Onkelos should have expressed “seeing” in the form of “being manifest before the Eternal,” and yet he translated them literally! Rambam then concludes that our version of Onkelos is inaccurate in those three cases! It is this conclusion of Rambam with which Ramban takes issue in the text before us.)  in [the following three places: the verse mentioned above, namely, And the Eternal saw], (Above, 6:5.)  and two other verses, (And G-d saw the earth, and behold it was corrupt, (above, 6:12). And the Eternal saw that Leah was hated, (above, 29:31).)  which Onkelos translated as, “and He saw,” since these translations do not fit his theory. With reference to expressions of “passing” Onkelos paraphrased and thus translated the expression, And the Eternal passed by before him, (Exodus 34:6.)  as, “and He caused His Presence to pass before his [Moses’] face.” He did this so that the passing object would be, in accordance with Onkelos’ opinion, something created, as he would not ascribe any expression of motion to the Creator in accordance with what the Rabbi has mentioned. (Moreh Nebuchim I, 21.)  But if this is so, why did Onkelos literally translate the verse, The Eternal thy G-d, He will go over before thee? (Deuteronomy 31:3. In our version of Onkelos, the text reads, “His word will go over.” Ramban’s objection is thus removed.)  This is a form of motion occurring in a narrative (As opposed to “the visions of the night.” See the beginning of the section where Ramban explains this distinction which Rambam makes.)  and yet Onkelos was not apprehensive about it! Similarly, Onkelos translated the verse, And Israel saw the great hand, (Exodus 14:31.)  as, “and Israel saw the power of the great hand.” He added the term “power” due to the subsequent expression, that the Eternal did, (Exodus 14:31.)  yet he left intact the expression, “the great hand” and was not apprehensive and fearful of the term “hand” being ascribed to G-d and did not paraphrase it at all! He did the same in literally translating, written with the finger of G-d. (Ibid., 31:18.)  The Rabbi’s answer (Moreh Nebuchim I, 66.)  that Onkelos thought that “the finger” was a created instrument which, by the will of the Creator, engraved the writing on the tablets, is not the truth. There is the verse, At His right hand was a fiery law unto them, (Deuteronomy 33:2.)  in translation of which Onkelos wrote, “His right hand,” and he was not apprehensive of “the right hand writing,” that is lest it indicate corporeality, and such is the case also with “the finger” as mentioned above. He furthermore literally translated: Thou stretchest forth Thy right hand (Exodus 15:12.)  as, “Thou raisest Thy right hand.” So also the verses: Thy right hand, O Eternal, dasheth in pieces the enemy; (Ibid., Verse 6.)  Thy strong hand; (Deuteronomy 3:24.)  By a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm; (Ibid., 4:34.)  And My hand take hold on judgment; (Ibid., 32:41.)  The eyes of the Eternal thy G-d are always upon it. (Ibid., 11:12.)  [Onkelos literally translated all of these verses without fear that the terms “hand” and “eyes” might indicate corporeality.] Now in the case of Jacob, the Scriptural narrative begins, And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, etc., and yet Onkelos, fearing corporeality, translated [the verse, And, behold, the Eternal stood beside him], (Above, 28:12-13.)  as “and, behold, the Glory of G-d stood beside him,” and he did not translate literally, “and, behold, the Eternal” although it was in a dream. (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon’s thesis is that the reason Onkelos did not paraphrase the verse, I will go down with thee into Egypt, but translated it literally, is that the narrative begins with a statement that it was in a vision of the night. Ramban questions this thesis, for in the story of the ladder, which is also introduced as a dream, Onkelos avoided possible indications of corporeality, and accordingly he paraphrased the verses.)  He further translated the expression, And, behold, I am with thee, (Above, 28:15.)  as “and, behold, My word will be in thy help,” and did not say literally, “and, behold, I am with thee,” just as he literally translated, “I will go down with thee,” even though the story of the ladder is a statement of what Jacob was told, [not a narrative of what took place], and is completely analogous to the narrative of the dream here. Again, Onkelos literally translated the expression, And I will be with thy mouth, (Exodus 4:12.)  [even though the story there is not introduced as a vision of the night or a dream], and on the other hand he translated the verse, And He said, Certainly I will be with thee, and this shall be the token unto thee, (Ibid., 3:12.)  as “behold, My word will be with thee.” Furthermore, Onkelos does not always translate literally in the case of dreams. Thus he rendered the verses, And G-d came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, (Above, 20:3.)  And G-d came to Laban in a dream, (Ibid., 41:22.)  as “and the word came from before G-d.” Should you say that Onkelos paraphrased it there because he was concerned lest one think that G-d came to them before the dream, and one might thus think that G-d’s appearance actually took place, [this would still not justify his using the expression, “and the word came,”] for in the case of Solomon it is written, In Gibeon the Eternal appeared to Solomon in a dream, (I Kings 3:5.)  and yet Jonathan ben Uziel (See Note 152 in Seder Noach.)  translated it as, “G-d revealed Himself to Solomon,” even though, according to Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, a narrative introduced as a dream is rendered by Onkelos and Jonathan as it was actually said. They find no difficulty in translating such a statement literally, even though the expression connotes corporeality, because since it occurs in a dream, they understand that it is inexact. Thus in the case of Solomon, since the Eternal appeared to him in a dream, it was proper for Jonathan to give a literal account of the occurrence, for since Scripture relates that it was in a dream by night, (I Kings 3:5.)  one would himself infer that it was not real but only a dream in which the person dreaming imagined it to be so. [Now since Jonathan did not paraphrase the account of Solomon’s dream, although Onkelos did so in the case of the dreams of Abimelech and Laban, it thus helps to disprove the thesis of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon that accounts of what occurred in man’s imagination are not paraphrased by the Targum.] Now do not think that Jonathan ben Uziel did this because the term “seeing” in reference to dreams is not found in Aramaic — for the verse, And I saw in my dream, (Above, 41:22.)  is indeed translated [in Targum Onkelos] as “I saw,” and in the case of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, it likewise says in Aramaic, Thou O King, sawest. (Daniel 2:31.)  And so did Onkelos translate the verse, Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Eternal, (Exodus 16:8.)  as “but against the word of G-d.” Onkelos thus paraphrased here even though there is no fear or apprehension of corporeality connoted by literal translation. Likewise, he translated And the people spoke against G-d, and against Moses (Numbers 21:5.)  as, “and the people murmured against the word of G-d.” So also the verses, Between Me and you, (Above, 9:12.)  and Between G-d and every living creature, (Ibid., Verse 16.)  were translated by Onkelos as: “between My word and you,” “between the word of G-d and every living creature.” There are many similar examples [of verses which he paraphrased in spite of the fact that there would have been no apprehension of intimating corporeality had he translated literally]. And so also he translated The Eternal watch (Ibid., 31:49.)  as “the word of G-d watch;” G-d is witness (Ibid., Verse 50.)  as “the word of G-d is witness.” Yet there would be no apprehension of corporeality had those expressions been literally translated. Besides, what sense is conveyed here by the expression, “the word of G-d’ watch or witness”? Similarly the verse, Swear unto me here by G-d, (Ibid., 21:23.)  is rendered by Onkelos as “swear unto me by the word of G-d,” although people who swear do not mention, “I swear by the word of G-d.” There are many other such cases in Onkelos, and their secret meaning is known to the learned students [of the mystic lore of the Torah]. Likewise, with respect to the term “standing” when applied to G-d, the Rabbi said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 28.)  that Jonathan ben Uziel’s intent was to explain it as meaning “to endure permanently,” and therefore he translated the expression, And His feet shall stand, (Zechariah 14:4.)  as “and He will appear in His might.” So also all expressions denoting contact and motion were rendered by him as “the might of G-d.” Yet Onkelos had no apprehension of the term “standing.” and he translated it literally: Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock. (Exodus 17:6.)  And concerning that which the Rabbi has said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  that all expressions denoting any mode of motion are rendered by Onkelos as the revelation of the Divine Presence, or the manifestation of a certain Glory that had been created for the occasion, now Onkelos avoids even literal translation of verses which mention “seeing” the Glory [of G-d, and would certainly oppose using it to denote expressions of motion]. Thus he translates the verse, And the glory of the Eternal appeared unto all the congregation, (Numbers 16:19.)  as “and the glory of G-d was manifested,” just as he said in translation of the verse, And the Eternal came down, (Exodus 19:20.)  “and the Eternal manifested Himself,” and did not translate it literally as “and the glory of the Eternal appeared.” He also likewise translates “seeing,” when referring to angels, as “and he manifested himself.” (Onkelos, ibid., 3:2.)  Now if it is as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  that in the case of angels, or manifestation of a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, Onkelos does not hesitate to literally translate expressions denoting corporeality, it would have been proper for him not to avoid expressions of literal “seeing” of angels by man, and should there translate it as “and he appeared,” just as he has literally rendered the verse, For I have seen ‘Elokim’ face to face, (Above, Verse 32.)  as “for I have seen an angel of G-d.” Heaven forbid that the Divine Presence or the Glory created for the occasion be anything except the glorious Divine Name, blessed be He, as the Rabbi has expressed himself here (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  and in many chapters of his book. Thus Onkelos translated the expression, If Thy face go not, (Exodus 33:15.)  as “if Thy Divine Presence go not among us.” Now, other than the glorious Divine Name, blessed be He, Moses did not want a special Glory created to go with him, since the Holy One, blessed be He, had already told him, Behold Mine angel shall go before thee, (Ibid., 32:34.)  and Moses was not pleased with it. He instead wanted that G-d in His own glory should go with him. Also, after G-d heard his plea and told him, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, (Ibid., 33:17.)  Moses said, Let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, (Ibid., 34:9.)  and this Onkelos rendered as “let now G-d’s Divine Presence go among us.” (We thus see that even here, where it is clear from the context that the verse refers to G-d and not an angel, Onkelos does not hesitate to translate “going” literally.)  He similarly translated the expression, Thou canst not see My face, (Ibid., 33:20.)  “thou cannot see the face of My Divine Presence, for man shall not see Me.” [In translating the verse in the book of Ezekiel, Blessed be the glory of the Eternal from His place,] (Ezekiel 3:12.)  Jonathan ben Uziel said, “Blessed be the glory of the Eternal from the region of His Divine abode.” Now if by this “Glory,” [which is mentioned in the book of Ezekiel] Scripture refers to the Creator in His true essence, analogous to the verse, Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory, (Exodus 33:18.)  which the Rabbi has indeed so interpreted, (Moreh Nebuchim I, 54 and 64.)  then how did [Jonathan ben Uziel] in translating the verse mention “the region of His Divine abode” [when the terms “region,” “abode,” etc., indicate corporeality]? And if one would say that the verse in Ezekiel refers to a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, as is the opinion of the Rabbi with respect to the verse, And the glory of the Eternal filled the tabernacle, (Exodus 40:35. Moreh Nebuchim I, 64.)  and other similar verses, then how did the angels direct their words, “Blessed, etc.,” towards it when he who blesses and prays to a glory created for an occasion is as he who worshipped idols? The teachings of our Rabbis also contain many texts which indicate that the name Shechinah (Divine Presence) is identical with G-d, blessed be He. But all these subjects, [some of which are rendered literally and some of which are paraphrased, are not influenced by a fear of using terms denoting corporeality but rather by secrets] of the Cabala (See Note 56 in Introduction to Sefer Bereshith.)  known to Onkelos and Jonathan ben Uziel, and the secrets thereof are revealed to those who know the mystic lore of the Torah. Thus in the Revelation on Mount Sinai, wherever Elokim is mentioned in that section, Onkelos renders it as “the Glory” or “the Word of G-d,” but when Scripture mentions the Tetragrammaton he does not so render it. All this is done by Onkelos with extraordinary care and wisdom, and I will yet mention (See Ramban on Exodus 20:19.)  this with the help of G-d, blessed be He. Now the reason that Onkelos literally translated the verse, And ‘Elokim’ spoke all these words, saying, (Ibid., 20:1.)  [rather than render it, “and the Glory of G-d spoke,” as he usually does wherever Elokim is mentioned], is that it is said, Face to face the Eternal spoke (Deuteronomy 5:4.)  unto your whole assembly. (Ibid., Verse 19.)  The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand. However, the reason why Onkelos here literally translated, I will go down with thee to Egypt, [and did not paraphrase it as “My Glory will go down with thee],” is that he wanted to allude to that which the Rabbis have said: (Mechilta Shirah 3. See also Megillah 29a.)  “When they were exiled to Egypt, the Divine Presence went with them, as it is said, I will go down with thee to Egypt. When they were exiled to Elam, the Divine Presence went down with them, as it is said, And I will set My throne in Elam.” (Jeremiah 49:38.)  Thus both the verse which speaks of G-d “saying” [namely, And He said, I am G-d, the G-d of thy father, etc.], (Verse 3 here.)  and [the verse which speaks of G-d] “going down,” [namely, I will go down with thee], are alike [for they both refer to the Creator in His true essence], as I have explained above, and therefore he could not, under any circumstances, have translated in any other way, as I have hinted. But there in the case of Jacob’s dream, Onkelos could not have literally translated, “and behold I am with thee,” [and was forced to paraphrase it as, “and My word will be in thy help],” (Above, 28:15.)  because it is written there, And, behold, the Eternal stood beside him. (28:13. Since the Tetragrammaton (“the Eternal”) represents the attribute of mercy, had Onkelos literally translated Verse 15, “and, behold, I am with thee,” it would have indicated that this attribute would follow Jacob into exile since at the outset of this matter in Verse 13, Scripture uses the Tetragrammaton. Hence Onkelos translated Verse 15 as, ‘and My word will be in thy help,’ which is a reference to the attribute of judgment. (Bei’ur Ha’lvush to Rekanati on the Torah, who quotes the words of Ramban.))  The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand. And due to the fact that Onkelos found the meaning of this verse not to be in line with its plain meaning, he therefore spurned [literally translating the rest of the verse, and rendered it as referring to assistance], and thus he said, “My word will be in thy help,” instead of saying “My word will be with you,” as he said in the case of Moses. (Ibid., 3:12.)  And may G-d show us wonders in His Torah."
31,3,Commentary,Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 31:3:1,"He will cross over before you: Behold we saw four expressions of providence in this section: ""He will precede (over) ahead of you""; ""He goes with you""; ""He is the one who will go ahead of you""; ""He will be with you."" And it is all precise. But we should first see the language of the Gemara, Pesachim 7b:    Shmuel said, ""With regard to all the commandments, one recites a blessing over them prior to (over) their performance."" From where may it be inferred that the word, over, is an expression of precedence?... Abbaye said... ""And their king preceded [vaya’avor] ahead of them"" (Micah 2:13).     But it is difficult, why did Shmuel say it with an expression that needs to be explained (why did he choose this unusual unclear expression, ""over their performance"")? He should say, ""kodem (before)"" their performance,"" or ""lifnei (ahead of)"" their performance!"" Rather there is a profound intention in this [choice of words]. Kodem and lifnei imply that he has not started with the commandment at all. As a result, he used the expression, ""over,"" which implies immediately adjacent; such that he is holding the item of the commandment in his hand, and he will then begin to recite the blessing. And this is the intention of, ""and their king passed ahead of them"" - as it is clear that the king will not begin to go until all of his army is ready to go out and they are standing at the border..."
31,3,Commentary,Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 31:3:2,"From here we understand the difference between that which is written about the time of the exodus from Egypt (Exodus 13:21), ""And the Lord went lifneihem (ahead of them) by day""... which implies, before Israel went - as behold Israel did not do anything, neither regarding the splitting of the Red Sea, nor regarding the killing of snakes and scorpions. However now Moses says that it shall not be so, but rather the Lord ""will over (precede) ahead of you"" - adjacently to your action..."
31,3,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:3:1-2","ה' אלוקיך הוא העובר לפניך, “the Lord your G’d, He will cross (the Jordan) in front of you.” Moses speaks to the whole nation. He repeats this line almost verbatim at the end of his address in verse 6. Personally, I feel that this paragraph was addressed by Moses exclusively to the ears of Joshua. By emphasizing the words ה' אלוקיך, Moses wanted to tell Joshua something about the high level of his prophetic powers. Targum Yonathan ben Uzziel also understood it in this sense when he rendered the words as שכינתיה, i.e. implying that “the Lord your G’d is walking ahead of you.” The word הוא is a limitation, suggesting that whereas the Lord Himself had walked ahead of Moses, His Shechinah, a lesser attribute, would walk in front of Joshua. Proof of this is found in verse 3 where Moses described the attribute of Hashem as speaking to him. No mention is made there of a lesser attribute than that of Hashem. Moses referred to the time in Deut. 3,26 when G’d had told him that he would not cross the Jordan. It says there ויאמר ה' אלי אל תוסף לדבר, “the Lord said to me: ‘do not continue to speak, etc.’” The careful phrasing of every single word in the written Torah reveals the nuances of intimacy with which G’d related to people such as Moses or Joshua, etc. This reflects the statement of our sages that if we compare the face of Moses to the sun, that of Joshua is comparable to the moon (Baba Batra 75)."
31,3,Quoting Commentary,"Redeeming Relevance; Deuteronomy, CHAPTER 6 Amalek versus Yehoshua 4","Perhaps more difficult to understand is the role played by Yehoshua. In the passage in Shemot, he appears out of nowhere to become the head of the Jewish army. Even more curious is the Torah’s insistence that his personal duty to fight against Amalek is to continue even after the war, such that God commands Moshe that the injunction to destroy Amalek be “placed in [Yehoshua’s] ears” (Shemot 17:14). To further complicate matters, he is called Yehoshua in this battle even though his name is formally changed from Hoshea to Yehoshua only later, in the story of the spies (Bemidbar 13:16). In short, Yehoshua dramatically appears on the scene, taking a major role in the conflict, and then goes right back into the shadows, appearing only occasionally throughout the rest of the Torah. (Most notably in the story of the spies (Bemidbar 13:1–14:10), even though he is relatively quiet, and in passages that have to do with the succession of leadership in Bemidbar 27:18–22 and Devarim 31:3–23.) "
31,3,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:3:2,"Concerning the fact that he had been able to assuage G'd's anger on two critical occasions, he now said that G'd would עובר לפניך, in the sense this word occurred in Exodus 17,5 where G'd had said to Moses עבור לפני העם, suggesting that Moses forgive, ""pass over"" the sins he had accused the people of committing. At that time, G'd wanted the miracle of producing water to be credited to Moses rather than to Himself. On another occasion, immediately after the sin of the golden calf, G'd had said to Moses: ""Let Me be so that I can destroy the people."" In other words, it had been G'd who had given Moses a hint that his prayer might help (Exodus 32,9). In view of this Moses said: ""He will pass over your sins Himself;"" you do not depend on me doing this for you."
31,3,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:3:3,"As far as Moses' prowess in warfare, He told the people that it was not his own personal strength which had performed all these valiant deeds but that G'd had been the real Warrior. As to the means G'd would employ in His fight against the Canaanites, Moses cited Joshua as the official representative who would march at the head of the army. "
31,3,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:3:4,"He emphasised the word הוא, ""he,"" to make clear that the fact that Joshua marches at the head was crucial. When the army of Israel [a small contingent of about 3.000 men. Ed.] suffered a defeat at the town of Ai (Joshua 7,5-15) and there were about 36 Jewish casualties, Joshua is reported as falling on his face complaining to G'd. One of the reasons cited by the Talmud Sanhedrin 44 for this defeat was that Joshua had not been at the head of that army contingent. He had not considered the objective as deserving his personal attention. Moses here stresses that it is Joshua's task to walk in front of the army."
31,3,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Ha'Azinu 3:1","(Deut. 32:1:) “Let my instruction drop down like the rain.” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “When Moses went up to the heights, the angels were about to kill him. (See ARN, A, 2:3; Shab. 88b; Exod. R. 28:1.)  He said to them, ‘Is it because of the two things that were granted to me [from the heavens] that you wish to kill me?’ When they heard this, they left him alone. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a great merchant who was walking in a dangerous place. [When some] brigands (Gk.: lestai.)  seized him [and] wanted to kill him, he said to them, ‘Is it because of the five minas (There are four hundred minas to a shekel.)  in my hand that you wish to kill me?’ But they did not know that there were in his hand precious stones and pearls (Gk.: margaritai or margeleis.)  which were invaluable. They said to each other, ‘What profit is there in killing him? He has nothing on him.’ So they left him alone. When he entered the city, he began to sell precious stones and pearls. They said to him, ‘When we captured you yesterday, you said, “There is nothing on me but five minas”; but now you are bringing out precious stones and pearls which are invaluable?’ He said to them, ‘When I spoke to you, I was in a dangerous situation.’ So also did Moses our master say to the angels, ‘There are [only] two things with me.’ [In fact] there was a great gift with him, as stated (in Ps. 68:19), ‘You ascended on high; [you captured captives; you received gifts for humans].’” (Some translations interpret the passage to mean that the gifts are from humans, but the midrash requires the interpretation given here.)  Therefore David said (in Ps. 119:72), “The Torah of Your mouth is better for me [than thousands of gold and silver pieces].” It also says (in Ps. 19:11), “More delightful are they than gold, than much fine gold”; and it says (in Ps. 12:7), “The sayings of the Lord are [pure] sayings....” Israel said to Moses our master, “Fortunate are you, for your having received gifts.” He said to them, “If I had not said to the ministering angels that there were [only] two things, I should have been burned by their fire, but this Torah saved me from their hand. It was with reference to them that he said (in Deut. 32:2), “Let my instruction drop down like the rain.” “Drop down (rt.: 'rp)” must mean killing, since it is stated (in Deut. 21:4), “and they shall break the neck (rt.: 'rp) of the heifer there”; and so too with Judah, it states (in Gen. 49:8), “your hand will be on the neck (rt.: 'rp) of your enemy.” And my instruction must mean Torah, since it is stated (in Prov. 4:2), “For I gave you good instruction....” And why is Torah compared to rain? To say [that] just as rain erodes, as it states (in Job 14:19), “Water erodes stones”; so does the Torah erode a heart of stone. And this is related to that which our masters say (in Qidd. 30b), “If [the evil impulse] is [like] a stone, it will be dissolved. If it is [like] iron, it will be shattered.” Therefore, there is nothing that is good for a man besides killing himself over the words of the Torah and to constantly occupy himself with it, day and night. And it is so stated (in Josh. 1:8), “and you shall meditate upon them night and day.” And this is related to that which they said (in Meg. 6b), “If a man tells you, “I have toiled but I have not found,’ do not believe [it].” And it is therefore compared to rain. Just like there can be no world without rain, as it is needed to grow all good things; so can the world not survive without Torah, as it is stated (Jer. 33:25), “Were it not that I have established My covenant day and night, I would not have put the laws of heaven and earth.” And just like rain descends little by little, so too with the Torah, one starts at the beginning with the small count of aleph, bet, gimmel, and comes to the large count of kof, reish, shin at the end. So does one start and then one understands the Torah and its details. Another interpretation (of Deut. 32:2), “Let my instruction drop down like the rain.” Israel said to Moses our master, “You have not come to speak with heaven and earth but with the rain and the dew.” He said to them, “[Let me tell you] a parable. It is comparable to a wealthy person who went to honor the king. He took with him great ministers and honored men. [So when] he went into the king along with them, the king received them cordially.” So also did Moses say, “It is better for me to call for heaven and earth, the rain and the dew to be with me, so that when I call upon the Holy One, blessed be He, He will answer me.” For that reason he said to them (in Deut. 32:1-2), “Give ear, O heavens…. Let [my instruction] drop down like the rain…”; and [then] afterwards (in Deut. 31:3), “For I am proclaiming the name of the Lord.”"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."

The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642).

All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

31,6,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Numbers 21:34:1,"FEAR HIM [Og] NOT. “For Moses was afraid [to wage war against Og] in case the merit of Abraham [whom Og had helped] would stand him in stead, for it is said about him, And there came ‘hapalit’ (one that had escaped) and told Abram the Hebrew, (Genesis 14:13.)  this being Og who had escaped from the Rephaim whom Amraphel (In our Rashi: “Chedarlaomer.”)  and his allies had defeated at Ashteroth-karnaim.” (Genesis 14:5.)  This is Rashi’s language, based on the words of our Rabbis. (Tanchuma, Chukath 25; Bamidbar Rabbah 19:19.)  Here too (See Ramban above at the end of Verse 1, where he mentions a similar idea. Hence he writes now: “here too.”)  the Rabbis were induced to make this comment because they knew that Moses our teacher would not have been afraid of an arm of flesh, for with him was the Eternal our G-d, (See II Chronicles 32:8.)  and all the nations are as nothing before Him; they are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity. (Isaiah 40:17.)  [Furthermore], it was he [Moses himself] who admonished Israel: fear not, nor be dismayed on account of them, (Deuteronomy 31:6.)  and who criticized them for being afraid of them, as it is said in connection with the [affair of the] spies, Then I said unto you: ‘Dread not, neither be afraid of them. The Eternal your G-d, Who goeth before you, He shall fight for you.’ (Ibid., 1:29-30.)  Therefore [we must say] that Moses was afraid [of Og] because he knew of his merit [in having helped Abraham]. In accordance with the plain meaning of Scripture, Moses had not intended now to give Israel the land of Sihon and Og as an inheritance, as I have explained. (Above, Verse 21.)  But Sihon had gone out against Israel into the wilderness, (Ibid., Verse 23.)  and had fought them against their will [in spite of their desire for peace]. Then G-d informed [Moses], Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee; begin to possess his land, (Deuteronomy 2:31.)  for here began the conquest of the seven nations [who inhabited the Land of Israel]. But Og [nonetheless] mobilized all his forces at Edrei, (Further, Verse 33.)  which was a city at the end of his border, and Israel could have turned away from him just as they had turned away from Esau [i.e., Edom]. (Above, 20:21.)  Therefore G-d told Moses, “Fear him not; go to him and contend with him in battle, for I have delivered him into thy hand.” And in Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah I have seen [the following text] (Bamidbar Rabbah, 19:19.)  “Why was Moses afraid [of Og]? He said: Perhaps Israel committed a trespass in the war against Sihon, [by taking of the spoil for themselves], or maybe they have become defiled by sins.” This is a completely homiletic exposition. And indeed all righteous people have this fear [that they might have sinned in error], (See Vol. I, p. 195.)  and this [fear] likewise occurred [in the case] of Joshua [about whom it says that G-d told him, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed]. (Joshua 8:1.)  Balak"

It seems that this is because whenever a reason is given it refers to what precedes it, and it is written Do not quake before them [and the reason is] because He will not make you weak. For this reason, “Do not quake before them.” is understandable if the meaning of yarpecha is that He will not give you weakness, to be abandoned from Him. Then it is understandable, for this reason “Do not fear,” because you are not [being] abandoned by Hashem. But if the meaning is He will not make you weak the phrase Do not quake cannot apply, because this is no reason not quake. This is also the explanation of R”em. "
31,6,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Shoftim 17:1","And when you approach the battle, the priest shall come forward and address the people (Deuteronomy 20:2): And so [too] does it state (Deuteronomy 21:5) ""The priests, the Sons of Levi, shall come forward."" And [regarding] anyone who serves the king, when the king makes a decree, he carries out his decree. And the Levites serve the Holy One, blessed be He, and carry out His decrees. ""Be strong and resolute, be not in fear or in dread in front of them"" (Deuteronomy 31:6). And why?  ""For the Lord your God Himself marches with you; He will not fail you or forsake you."" He does not leave you, and He goes forth in front of you and makes war. And so Deborah says to Barak, ""Rise, this is the day on which the Lord will deliver Sisera into your hands; is not the Lord going forth before you"" (Judges 4:14). But Barak said to her (Judges 4:8), ""If you go with me, I shall go."" [So] she said to him, ""Do you need me, 'is not the Lord going forth before you?'"" [In the case of] a king of flesh and blood, his servants and his troops go forth to war and he is behind them. But the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like this, but rather He is first. And so is it written with David (II Samuel 5:23-24), ""Do not go up, etc. but confront them at the baca trees. And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca trees, then go into action."" As they are full of thorns. And why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal himself from the tops of the baca trees? Because Israel was in distress. Rabbi Berakhia said, ""This is that which is stated, 'I am with him in distress'"" (Psalms 91:15). ""For the Lord will be going in front of you to attack within the Philistine camp."" Hence, ""For the Lord your God Himself marches with you."" And in the world to come, ""Then the Lord will come forth and make war on those nations as He is wont to make war on a day of battle"" (Zechariah 14:3). So did Rabbi Tanchuma bar Abba expound."
31,6,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 21:34:1","אל תירא אותו, “do not fear him!” Since it was not appropriate for Moses to be in awe and trepidation of any human being seeing he always had the power of the Shechinah at his side, why did G’d have to tell him not to be afraid of Og? Do we not have the prophet telling even lesser individuals than Moses “who are you (Israel) that you should be afraid of mortal man?” (Isaiah 51,12). The prophet means that if the righteous display (or feel) fear of mortal man this undermines the well-being of his soul, his personality. Even Moses personally warns the people in Deut. 1,29 and 31,6 not to be afraid of the Canaanites.  The reason Moses did fear Og was because he had earned some merits when he told Avraham of Lot’s being captured. [The fact that this man had survived all these years plus at least 300 years prior to Avraham when he rode out the deluge on the roof of the ark, made Moses worry (compare Niddah 61)].   Seeing we have a tradition that Og and Sichon were brothers, why was Moses afraid of Og whereas he is not reported as being afraid of Sichon? [G’d’s telling Moses not to be afraid of Og makes it clear that he must have been afraid]. Og’s longevity and size made Moses wonder if his merits had been used up. This is why he was afraid and needed reassurance."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,13,Halakhah,"From Sinai to Ethiopia, Shulhan haOrit; The Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now, 3 Shabbat 9:5","The Babylonian Talmud notes that the Jews in Eretz Yisrael completed reading the entire Torah in three years, while in Babylonia, they completed it in one year. According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "
31,6,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:6:1","V. 6. חזקו וגו׳, seid fest im Widerstand und stark im Überwinden (siehe Kap. 3, 28) אמץ: vielleicht (מצ (ה) ,מצ (א mit vorgesetztem א: etwas für sich erreichen."
31,6,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:6:2","אל תיראו ואל תערצו (siehe Kap. 1, 29). – רפה ,לא ירפך heißt schwach sein, erschlaffen, und לא ירפך könnte heißen: er wird dich nicht schwach sein lassen, רפה ist ja der Gegensatz von חזק (Bamidbar 13, 18), und würde dann לא ירפך die Anforderung: חזקו unterstützen, wie לא יעזבך die Anforderung: אמצו. Allein in allen Stellen, in welchen הרפה mit dem Suffixum des Akkusativs vorkommt, heißt es: etwas loslassen, etwas fahren lassen, es nicht weiter festhalten, also: seine festhaltende Kraft in Beziehung auf etwas nicht üben. So אחזתיו ולא ארפנו (Hohel. 3, 4), בצדקתי החזקתי ולא אַרפֶהָ (Job. 27, 6), לא תרפני עד בלעי רוקי (daselbst 7, 19). So ja auch הַרִפו ,הֶרֶף, wie Dewarim 9, 14, Sam. I. 15, 16 usw.

Es ist dies dann ebenfalls eine Unterstützung der Anforderung: חזקו, bleibet fest, lasst euch nicht überwinden, denn es ist Gottes Hand, die euch festhält; wenn ihr treu an ihm haltet, muss man seine Hand überwinden, wenn man euch überwinden will.

31,6,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:6,"Be strong and courageous; do not fear or be intimidated before them , as the Lord your God, it is He who goes with you, and He will not fail you, or remove His grasp from you, and He will not forsake you."
31,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 24:1:5,"G-d says, ""Do not be afraid for I am with you"" (Isaiah 41,10). The implication is that without Me, you will not prevail since you have no enduring foundations. In Isaiah 31,3, we read, ""As soon as G-d withdraws His hand, the helper will fail, the recipient of help will collapse."" Here the prophet describes that relying on human help is useless, since human power endures only as long as He does not withdraw His power. For that reason, our sages describe all material wealth as kinyanim medumim, as apparent possessions. On occasion, failure to own such possessions may be preferable to owning them. Our sages teach that whereas virtues fulfill their functions only when we acquire them, material goods may only fulfill their purpose when we spend them. If these material possessions then are useful only as a means to an end, they themselves cannot be of enduring value. Since material possessions evoke in man the desire to amass forever more of them, they cannot be true possessions, since they do not satisfy the owner, but act as a reminder of all the things the owner has not yet acquired. Proverbs 23, 1-4 warns us not to wear ourselves out in the pursuit of riches, but to excercise restraint when a guest at the lavish banquet tendered by the king, since whatever is offered is based on deceit. His advice, if translated into the jargon of Mussar teachers, is, “Do not let the goodies dangled before your eyes by the yetzer hara, evil urge, bedazzle you, since what is being dangled before your eyes is merely a mirage. Sanhedrin 107 describes a small organ, which if fed, becomes insatiable, but which if starved, i.e. kept to strict rations, will find its satisfaction. The organs are the eye and the heart; both have enormous appetites as attested in Numbers 16,39, ""Do not follow the dictates of your hearts or your eyes which are apt to lead you astray."" The Talmud relates the lesson learned by Alexander the great, who tried to weigh a human eye handed to him from beyond the borders of Paradise; he found that all his silver and gold did not equal the weight of that eye (Tamid 32). When frustrated at this discovery, he was advised to sprinkle some dust on the eye. He was then able to determine the weight of the eye immediately. The lesson conveyed is that while alive, the eye is insatiable in its greed, and all the gold in the world does not suffice to still its appetite. As soon as it is dead however, all these appetites evaporate. "
31,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 90:1:4,"Joseph's brothers say to their father: ""recognise whether this is the coat of your son or not."" (Genesis 37,32) We are told to remember what Amalek did to us. (Deut. 25,17) We are told not to fear nations surrounding us. (Deut 7,18-21) Since we are human beings, not just animals, it is expected that we can refine certain characteristics, are not limited to instinctive reactions. If one can learn to compensate for the weakness of certain of one's senses, then surely one can find means to reinforce certain character traits. A blind man develops a more acute sense of hearing. A shortsighted person can improve his vision by the use of spectacles. A person suffering from certain character weaknesses must also find means to compensate for this. Using one's power of imagination, one can imagine situations that make one's phobias seem unjustified and ridiculous. The process of thought association with specific objects is known to be an excellent memory jogger. These aids must be applied when we are asked to observe certain commandments involving remembrances. Seeing the tzitzit reminds us of other mitzvot such as kilayim, forbidden mixtures. This has been discussed at greater length in chapter sixty five. Awareness of the importance of memory joggers may have led some prophets to find common denominators for certain mitzvot, and thus make it easy for us to have these short summaries constantly at our command. Isaiah manages to condense Torah into two slogans, ""observe justice and perform righteousness."" (chapter 56) Chabakuk manages to sum it up in a single slogan, ""the righteous will live by his faith"" (2,4). No doubt the purpose of these apparent over simplifications is simply to provide a constant reminder, which when triggered will remind us of all the other mitzvot which are incumbent upon us to perform. When the Talmud (Ketuvot 30) tells us that all is in the hands of Heaven except the contracting of colds and heatstrokes, we know very well that both those phenomena are natural phenomena and as such not subject to our control. In fact, no remedy has yet been found for the common cold. Nevertheless, the sages are telling us that if one falls victim to those two ailments, this is due to negligence on the part of man, to wilful over-exposure etc, and cannot be blamed on outside forces. Just as one can control colds and heatstrokes, so, by employing memory properly, one can reinforce one's senses of trust and confidence in the help of G'd, no matter what the circumstances. This is what David said (Psalms 27,1) ""The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?, The Lord is the source of my strength, of whom shall I be afraid?"" He means that if his attitude is based on remembering G'ds many past acts of kindness and assistance, why would he be afraid of anyone in the future? In the same vein, Moses tells the people: ""you are today about to cross the Jordan in order to dispossess people greater and more powerful than you etc."" (9,1). This calls for faith and confidence based on the recollection of all the past triumphs achieved through Divine intervention. The foremost memory jogger is the keriyat shema, which for that reason has been included in our daily prayers three times. We will examine the passage in detail to gain a better understanding of its significance. The following questions suggest themselves: "
31,7,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:7:1,"כי אתה תבוא את העם הזה — Translate this as the Targum does: ארי אתה תעול עם עמא הדין, THOU SHALT GO WITH THIS PEOPLE. Moses, by the statement “Thou shall go with this people” (as one of them) said in effect to Joshua: The elders of the generation will be with thee: everything has to be done according to their opinion and their advice. The Holy One, blessed be He, however, said to Joshua, (v. 23) “For thou shalt bring (תביא) the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them” — thou shalt bring them even against their will; everything depends on you alone: if necessary take a stick and beat them over the head: there can be but one leader for a generation, and not two leaders for a generation (Sanhedrin 8a)."

All Joshua was required to do was to march at the head of the people. While it is true that our sages in Sanhedrin 8 drew our attention to the end of our portion (verse 23) where G'd tells Joshua ""you shall bring the children of Israel to the land I have sworn to them,"" the reason that G'd used the expression תביא was to correct the impression Moses' words had left when he said תבא. According to Rabbi Yochanan Moses meant ""you and the elders."" G'd objected by saying that there can only be one authoritative spokesman per generation, i.e; dabbar echad ledor. To make this point, G'd said to Joshua ""you will bring,"" instead of ""you will come."" Now that we have that verse we can interpret the verse in which Moses said ""you will come"" as a reminder that G'd would do the actual ""bringing."""
31,7,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Numbers 27:12:1,"GET THEE UP INTO THIS MOUNTAIN OF ABARIM. The name of this mountain was Mount Nebo, as is stated explicitly in the sections of Ha’azinu, (Deuteronomy 32:49.)  and ‘V’zoth Habrachah; (Ibid., 34:1.)  but it is [here] called the mountain of Abarim [meaning “fords”] because it is situated by the fords of the Jordan, from which one passes over into the land of Canaan, as it says here, that is over against Jericho, (Ibid., (32:49; 34:1). The word “here” in Ramban cannot be explained literally, since in this section here, the phrase over against Jericho is not found. It must therefore refer to the verse in Ha’azinu and V’zoth Habracha which Ramban has just referred to.)  and it was from there that they [actually] crossed over the Jordan, as it is said, And the people came up out of the Jordan … and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho. (Joshua 4:19.)  Now this [statement get thee up] is not a commandment which the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses to fulfill now, for if so he would have had to go up there at once [and we do not find that he did so], but it means: “you shall go up into the mountain of Abarim and shall behold the Land [but you shall not enter it].” For since He had commanded Moses, Unto these the Land shall be divided, (Above, 26:53.)  He informed him that “it will not be divided by you, but you shall go up into the top of the mountain of Abarim before Israel journeys away from the land of Moab, and you will die therein, and all you will have of the Land will be the sight thereof.” Similarly [Verse 18 which says] Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, means that “when your time [to die] comes, you shall take Joshua,” [but is not a command to do so now]. And Scripture completed [this episode] by saying that Moses did so whole-heartedly, (Ibid., Verses 22-23. This refers to the fact that although Moses was only commanded (in Verse 18) to lay “his [single] hand upon him,” he laid his ‘hands’ upon him, which shows that he appointed his successor whole-heartedly, although he knew that he was now to die.)  and this is the [same] act which is mentioned at [the time of] Moses’ departure [from the world], (Deuteronomy 31:7-8.)  when he and Hoshea the son of Nun spoke [the words of] the Song. (Ibid., 32:44. Thus Scripture points out there that Moses and Joshua said the Song together, with equal enthusiasm and equally whole-heartedly.) "
31,7,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Numbers 27:19:1,"AND THOU SHALT COMMAND HIM [Joshua] — “concerning Israel, [saying to him]: ‘Know that they are troublesome, that they are stubborn. [Accept this position of leadership over them with full awareness of this and] on condition that you take upon yourself [all this].’” This is the language of Rashi. But it is not correct in my opinion, because it says [and thou shalt command him] before their eyes [and Moses would not have told Joshua to say such words in their presence], for this matter ought rather to have been told to him [Joshua] between the two of them [Moses and Joshua]; for if he would say it in their presence, it would [only] have caused them to break off all restraint. And it would have been more fitting that he [Moses] should chastise the people, warning them separately [and not in Joshua’s presence] not to be troublesome and stubborn any more [rather than to tell Joshua, in their presence, that they were a troublesome and stubborn people]! But [the meaning of] and thou shalt command him before their eyes is that you should instruct him in the duties of a prince and judge, since it was because he [Joshua] was to be their leader that he entrusted them to his care. [Therefore] he should [indeed] have warned him to exert himself exceedingly on their behalf, and to fight the battles of the Eternal, and that he should be the one to go out before them [in battle] and to bring them in, (Above, Verse 17.)  and that he should be careful in matters of judgment. These [instructions] indeed ought to be said in their presence, in order that they should trust him and listen to him, for they would then know that he will treat their affairs in a truthful manner, since his master had so commanded him. And this is what Moses [actually] did, as it is said there, And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel: ‘Be strong and of good courage etc. fear not, neither be dismayed.’ (Deuteronomy 31:7-8.)  And in the Sifre [we find the following text]: (I have not found this exact text in our editions of Sifre. For the closest approximation, see my Hebrew commentary, p. 316, Note 93.)  “And command Joshua (Deuteronomy 3:28.)  — concerning instruction [learning and teaching Torah]. (Moses is hereby told to transmit the Torah to Joshua, and to command him to teach it further to Israel. See Aboth 1:1 — “Moses received the Torah on Sinai, and handed it down to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, etc.”)  And encourage ‘him,’ and strengthen ‘him.’ (Deuteronomy 3:28.)  This teaches us that there cannot be two leaders in one generation.” Now these are duties of the prince, to be firm and not to be afraid of the people. In my opinion the plain meaning of Scripture is that the explanation of [the expression] ‘v’tzav’ (and thou shalt command) him before their eyes is [that it refers to] appointing [him officially as their leader], for Moses was to appoint Joshua in the presence of the people to be the ruler over them. This is similar to [the expression], from the time ‘tzivah othi’ (I was appointed) to be their governor etc. (Nehemiah 5:14.)  So also: ‘vayetzaveihu’ (and the Eternal hath appointed him) to be the prince over His people. (I Samuel 13:14.)  Similarly, Even from the day that ‘tzivithi’(‘I commanded’) judges to be over My people Israel, (II Samuel 7:11.)  which means “I appointed” [and likewise all these expressions of ‘tzav,’ which literally mean “command,” here mean “appoint”]."

He, too, that I appoint over Israel will go and stand at Elazar's door (to learn from him). To what may this be compared? A king had a son fit for royalty and he took the (governance of the) kingdom from him and gave it to his lover, telling him: Though I gave you greatness, go and stand at my son's door. Likewise, the Holy One Blessed be He said to Joshua: Go and stand at the door of the sons of Elazar, viz. (Bamidbar 27:21) ""And before Elazar the Cohein shall he (Joshua) stand."" At that time the strength of Moses increased and he strengthened Joshua before the eyes of all of Israel, as it is written (Devarim 31:7) ""And Moses called to Joshua and he said to him before the eyes of all of Israel: 'Be strong and firm!'"" Behold, the people that I am giving you are still kids, still infants. Do not be censorious of what they do, for neither was their Master, viz. (Hoshea 11:1) ""For Israel was a youth and I loved him,"" and (Song of Songs 1:8) ""And graze your kids by the dwellings of the shepherds"" — Take them into the shepherds' tents. Variantly: (Ibid.) ""beikvei hatzon"" — They were trodden down by the heel (ekev). ""And graze your kids""."

31,7,Talmud,Sanhedrin 8a:7,"Similarly, a distinction is drawn between two verses where Moses commanded Joshua concerning his impending leadership: It is written: “For you shall go with these people into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:7), and it is written: “For you shall bring the children of Israel into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:23). Rabbi Yoḥanan reconciled the difference between these two charges and said: Moses said to Joshua, in the first verse: You and the elders of the generation will enter into Eretz Yisrael together with the people, i.e., the elders will assist you in the leadership. Subsequently, in the second verse, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Joshua: You yourself must bring the people: Take a rod and strike the people upon their skulls. There must be one clear and authoritative leader for the generation, and there may not be two or more leaders for the generation."

Deut. 31.7–8.)  "
31,7,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Maaser Sheni 5:3:3,"It is written (Deut. 14:28): “At the end of three years you shall take out all tithe of your produce, in that year, and deposit it in your gates.” I could think that once in a Sabbatical cycle you have to distribute the tithes including the tithe of the poor (The tithe of the poor is mentioned separately since the paragraph in question introduces the tithe of the poor.) . The verse says “at the end of three years,” once in three years and not once in seven; i. e., in the third and the seventh (This formulation is inconsistent. It must either be the 3rd and the 6th year for the obligation of tithes, or the 4th and the 7th which are finally determined to be the times of delivery.) , twice in a Sabbatical cycle. Do I understand at New Year’s Day, that on New Year’s Day you have to distribute the tithes including the tithe of the poor? The verse says “at the end of three years.” “At the end” means at its conclusion you remove, you do not remove on New Year’s Day. If it is at the end of the year, I could understand that at the beginning of the fourth you have to remove the tithes including the tithe of the poor; the verse says (Deut. 26:12): “If you have finished tithing [all tithe of]78 (In the masoretic text, missing in the quote.)  your produce,” when you have tithed all your fruits.  (From here on, including the tannaitic parts of the next two paragraphs, a similar text is in Sifry Deut. §109; in very shortened form also §302.)  If it is when you have tithed all your fruits, could I understand even on Ḥanukkah (Since Ḥanukkah is not connected with the agricultural year and is not a biblical holiday, its mention does not make much sense, in particular because the tithing year for trees and their fruits ends only on the 14th of Ševaṭ, more than a month and a half after the start of Ḥanukkah. The 15th of Ševaṭ is mentioned as “New Year of trees” in Mishnah Roš Haššanah 1:2; in the opinion of the House of Shammai it is the first of Ševaṭ. This indetermination in itself disqualifies the New Year of trees as a biblical date. The discussion of the date is in Roš Haššanah 1:2 (fol. 57a), Babli 14a.) ? It says here, “at the end of;” it says further (Deut. 26:12): “At the end (In the biblical text, מקץ not מקצה.)  of seven years, on the fixed time of the Sabbatical year, on the festival of booths.” Since “at the end” there means at a fixed time, so here also at a fixed time. Since there “at the end” means the holiday of booths, does it here also mean the holiday of booths? The verse says “if you have finished tithing all tithe of your produce,” when you have finished tithing all of your fruits? On Passover of the fourth year (Since this is the first biblical holiday after the end of tithing fruits of the preceding year.) ."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

31,9,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Psalms 19:8:1,"The Law of the Lord: – Why does he join the idea of the Law with that of the sun ? His meaning is, that as the heavens and the sun and the spheres are witnessing to and declaring the glory of God and His wisdom, so the Law and the Commandments which He has commanded His people Israel witness to His wisdom and uprightness, as it says (Deut. 4:8), ""(What great nation is there) that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this Law ?"" And further he says that as the heavens and the sun benefit the world, and through them the world continues to exist, so is the Law, which is perfect and restores the soul, and upon which (depends) the preservation of the soul as the preservation of the world (depends) upon the sun; for the soul in the body is as a stranger in a foreign land who has none to help or assist him, for the agents which minister to the body are for the most part such as follow after the appetites, and she (the soul) is as a solitary one and captive amongst them. So also says Solomon, who compares her to a poor wise man (Koh. 9:15). And notice the Law restoreth the soul in that it teaches man the right way and draws him away from worldly desires and from many stumbling-blocks. And notice it restoreth the soul from captivity and confinement to her (rightful) birth and the place of her glory. And David declares in respect of the Law and the commandments and the judgments, their truth and uprightness. Now the Law (תורה, lit. teaching) is the orderly setting forth of the commandment with reference to the manner of its performance; and this (may be understood) from the general sense of such passages as ""I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers (מורי)"" (Prov. 5:13); ""and to teach (להורת) He hath put in his heart"" (Exod. 35:34); for (the Torah) teaches the ordering of a thing, as ""the law (Torah) of the beast and of the fowl"" (Lev. 11:46); ""the law of the leper"" (ibid. 14:2); ""the law of her that beareth"" (ibid. 12:7); ""the law of him that hath an issue"" (ibid. 15:32); ""the law of the Nazirite"" (Num. 6:21). Nevertheless the book (itself) is called by the name of the Law (Torah) from Genesis to Deuteronomy, as is written (Deut. 31:9): ""And Moses wrote this Law""; ""Take this book of the Law"" (ibid. 26); (this is) because it narrates the history of Creation and also narrates the affairs of the Fathers; it likewise sets forth every single one of the things which teach about God: that He is the founder of the world, of His goodness and of the beings created by Him, and His providence in the case both of the good and the evil. He mentions the commandments also – that is, what God commanded (man) to do in the ways of the service of God and love of Him, as of a master who gives commandment to his servant. And the testimony – that is, what was testimony between Israel and God, that they had accepted Him for (their) God, and He had accepted them for a peculiar people; cf ""the ark of the testimony"" (Exod. 25:22); ""the tent of the testimony"" (Num. 17:23). For the commandments about which Israel received commands – these are the testimony, and also the tables which had on them the Ten Words, which contain (are) the whole Law entirely; and these Words were a great testimony to Israel when they saw His glory on Mount Sinai in the thunderings and lightning; and that great sight was the testimony to them and their children for ever. So also the observance of the Sabbath and the festivals is to them a testimony and a sign and memorial; the (year of) release also, and the jubilee – all is a testimony to them and their children for ever; as it says, ""for all the earth is Mine"" (Exod. 19:5); ""they are My servants"" (Lev. 25:55). He says: the precepts of the Lord in respect of the commandments of the understanding which God has ordained and put in the heart; and about these the understanding teaches. He says fear because it is the beginning of the commandments and their root; for the servant, unless he fear the master, will not do his behests, and perfect fear is in secret. He says also judgments – that is, the rules (that are to be observed) between a man and his fellow. Now it is to be noticed he has mentioned for us all the different kinds of commandments except ""statutes"" (חקים). The reason is that he applies to them (such epithets as) perfect, restoring the soul, sure, making wise the simple, right, rejoicing the heart, pure, enlightening the eyes, clean, true, righteous altogether, to be desired, and sweet; all which it is only admissible to apply to the commandments whose reason is clear and apparent; whereas the ""statutes,"" such as those regarding the eating of swine's flesh and wearing mixed stuffs and the like, whose reason is not clear to all how could it be said of them that they are to be desired, are sweet and pure ? And although they are such to him to whom their reasonableness is apparent, yet this is not apparent to the great majority of men. And he says:"
31,9,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:3:2,"עד היום הזה UNTO THIS DAY — I have heard that on the day when Moses gave the Book of the Law to the sons of Levi, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:9) “And he gave it to the priests the sons of Levi”, all Israel came before Moses and said to him: Teacher Moses, we, too, stood at Sinai and accepted the Torah, and it was given to us; why, then, do you give the people of your tribe control over it, that they may tomorrow say to us, “Not to you was it given, but to us was it given”? Moses rejoiced at this matter and in reference to this he said to them, (Deuteronomy 27:9) “This day have you become the people [of the Lord thy God]”, meaning, Only this day have I come to understand that you are attached to and have a desire for the Omnipresent."
31,9,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 10:8:1","בעת ההיא הבדיל ה' את שבט הלוי, “At that time Hashem set apart the tribe of Levi, etc.” According to Rashi, the “time” referred to by Moses was the episode of the golden calf.
    Nachmanides adds that if we accept Rashi’s comment it refers not to the actual setting apart of the tribe of Levi by Hashem, but to the time when Hashem made up His mind to do so. In fact, no action was taken until the second year in the second month. Alternately, what Rashi had in mind was Exodus 32,26-29, when Moses asked for volunteers to execute the people who had actively worshipped the golden calf as a deity. At that time only members of the tribe of Levi had responded to that call. 
    Personally, (Nachmanides writing) I believe that the correct interpretation is that the words בעת ההיא which appear here a second time, refer to the same time as the first time Moses used this expression, (10,1) the time when Moses had been invited to carve out the Tablets for G’d to inscribe the second set of Ten Commandments upon. At the time when G’d became reconciled with His people, He did make some changers in the hierarchy of that people by appointing the Levites en masse to take over the functions previously reserved for the first born in each family. At that time G’d had also become reconciled to Aaron’s role in that tragic episode, and He commanded to make the special vestments for the High Priest which proclaimed to all the people that Aaron as well as his sons were held in high esteem by Hashem. At that time Moses had also been commanded to arrange for the seven days of consecration of the Tabernacle and the inauguration of the priests into their positions. This also enabled Moses to say that Eleazar became High Priest in place of his (deceased) father, as there was no need for him to be anointed first, seeing that the anointment to the priesthood, by the oil of anointment was for the members of that family something hereditary, and did not need to be renewed every time a new High Priest was appointed. The setting apart of the priests from the ordinary Levites, and the Levites from the other tribes of the Israelites, occurred simultaneously. Hashem had decided at the time of the episode of the golden calf that these changes were imperative for the development of the people as His people, and that is implied in the lineנתונים נתונים , that the Levites were, so to speak, placed at the disposal of the priests to assist them in their holy tasks. (Numbers 8,16-19)
    Another possible approach to the words בעת ההיא on this occasion, is that at that time Hashem decided to set apart the priests from the remainder of the tribe of Levi, in that they too were allowed to carry the Holy Ark. [only the descendants of Kehat, one of the families of the tribe of Levi, had qualified for that privilege, anyways. Ed.] We have proof that the priests did carry the Holy Ark from Deut. 31,9 ויכתוב משה את התורה הזאת ויתנה אל הכהנים בני לוי הנושאים את ארון ברית ה', “Moses wrote down this Torah and gave it to the priests, the members of the tribe of Levi, who carried the Ark of the covenant of Hashem.” They are the ones who would perform the sacrificial service and bless the people in the name of Hashem.

31,9,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:9:1","ויכתוב משה את התורה הזאת, “Moses wrote down this whole Torah, etc.” The whole Torah from Genesis to the last word in vezot hab’rachah. This is so, in spite of the fact that when the Torah reports that he read it all out באזניהם, as G’d had commanded him, “before their ears,” this suggests that they heard him report about his death and about his funeral, etc. 
    [I do not know what verse the author refers to. I have not found a verse which states that Moses read out the entire Torah before the people. Verses 11-12, refer to hakhel, and about a location that G’d has chosen for that event, certainly not to the wilderness of Moav.

31,9,Talmud,Gittin 59b:6,"GEMARA: The mishna teaches that at public readings of the Torah, a priest reads first, and after him a Levite. The Gemara asks: From where are these matters derived?

The Gemara explains the inference: Is that to say I do not know that the priests are the sons of Levi? Why is it necessary for the verse to say this? Rather, the Torah was first delivered to the priests and afterward to the other Levites, and this serves as the source for the enactment that first a priest reads from the Torah, and after him a Levite."

So the Sages taught: One writes documents of betrothal and marriage only with the consent of both, and the groom pays the wages. From whom did they learn this? From the Holy One blessed be He, when the Holy One blessed be He sanctified Israel at Sinai, as it is written: “The Lord said to Moses: Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow” (Exodus 19:10). Who wrote that document? It was Moses. From where is this derived? “Moses wrote this Torah” (Deuteronomy 31:9). What reward did the Holy One blessed be He give him? It was the radiance of his face, as it is written: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant” (Exodus 34:29). When? “Upon His speaking with him” (Exodus 34:29).   Reish Lakish said: When he wrote the Torah, Moses received the radiance of his face. How so? Reish Lakish said: The Torah that was given to Moses, its parchment was white fire, it was written with black fire, sealed with fire, and bound with fire. As he was writing, he wiped the quill in his hair, and it was from there that he received the radiance of his face. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Moses received the radiance of his face from the Tablets. As the Tablets were given to him, from hand to hand, he received the radiance of his face. When Israel performed that act, he took [the Tablets] and shattered them. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘When you served as an intermediary for Israel, I gave you the reward of radiance of the face, now, you shattered the Tablets.’ Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Our Rabbis taught: If the barrel broke, it broke for the intermediary. (He is the one who must replace it. )  The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You were the intermediary between Me and my children – you shattered it, you replace it.’ From where is this derived? From that which is written: “The Lord said to Moses: Carve for yourself two tablets of stone, like the first, and I will write on the Tablets the words that were on the first Tablets that you shattered. And be prepared for the morning, and you shall ascend in the morning to Mount Sinai, and you shall stand there for Me at the top of the mountain. No man shall ascend with you and no man shall be seen on the entire mountain. The flocks and the cattle shall not graze facing that mountain” (Exodus 34:1–3)."
31,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Tetzaveh 9:2","Another explanation of The wise shall inherit honor. This refers to Joshua, who inherited honor from Moses, our master, when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee (Josh. 1:5). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Put off thy shoes from off thy feet (Exod. 3:5), and to Joshua He said: Put off thy shoe from off thy foot (Josh. 5:15). Concerning Moses it is written: Then sang Moses and the children of Israel (Exod. 15:1), and about Joshua it is said: Then spoke Joshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord delivered (Josh. 10:12). Moses led them out of Egypt, while Joshua led them into the Holy Land. Moses slew Sihon and Og, while Joshua slew thirty-one kings. Moses halted the revolution of the sun in the war with Amalek, as it is said: And Moses lifted up his hand (Exod. 17:11). The word lifted up refers to his halting of the revolution of the sun, as it is said: The deep uttereth its voice, and lifteth up its voice on high (Hab. 3:10). Joshua did likewise, as is said: Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, moon, in the valley of Aijalon (Josh. 10:12). Moses erected an altar, as it is said: And Moses built an altar (Exod. 17:15), and Joshua did likewise: Then Joshua built an altar (Josh. 8:3). Moses wrote the law, as is said: And Moses wrote this law (Deut. 31:9), and Joshua did also, as it is said: And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God (Josh. 24:26). And so this was in every instance."
31,9,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 33:5:2","A Midrashic approach (Pessikta Zutrata): The “king” referred to in the line ויהי בישורון מלך, is Moses, seeing that people had heard the entire Torah (legislation) from his mouth. The Torah means that the manner in which all the people including their tribal heads assembled around him, gave Moses the stature of king. This was not the first time that Moses had acted as lawgiver. It had occurred in Deut. 31,9 already when he had given the Torah to the priests, the Levites, carriers of the Holy Ark. We also find Moses ordering all the people to appear in his presence in Deut. 31,28.  Another way of understanding our verse is that the “king” described here is G’d Himself. The Torah describes that G’d became king only when all the tribal heads assembled. We find something similar described in Psalms 47,8-10 where David refers to G’d’s position as “king” in connection with the leaders of mankind indicating that they accept Him as such. In the case of the Jewish people: “when the leaders of the people volunteered to rally around Him.” We have another similar description of G’d becoming king in Amos 9,6. [The prophet portrays that G’d cannot build His chambers in heaven until an assembly of His loyal people have laid the foundation for this on earth. Ed.] The common denominator in all these verses is that G’d does not impose Himself as “king,” but waits until His creatures manifest their desire for Him to be their king."
31,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:9:1","ויכתוב משה את התורה הזאת, “Moses wrote down this Torah.” This means that he wrote down the entire Torah commencing with Genesis up to the last words in Deut. 34,12: “before the eyes of all of Israel.” When we read in verse 11 of our chapter: “you will read this Torah,” this refers only to the Book of Deuteronomy (Sotah 41)."
31,9,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:9:1","When it was completely finished, etc. Rashi's intention is to explain that the Torah that is mentioned here means the entire Torah from Bereishis until in view of all of Yisroel (Devarim 34:12). It is not referring to the Torah which he wrote after this, which means only Mishne Torah [Devarim]. For why would he give only Mishne Torah to the Kohanim, and not the entire Torah? "
31,9,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 1:1,"(Devarim 1:1) ""These are the words which Moses spoke, etc."": Now did Moses prophesy only these? Did he not write the entire Torah, viz.

(Ibid. 32:15) ""And Yeshurun grew fat and it kicked, etc."""
31,9,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 10:8:1,"AT THAT TIME THE ETERNAL SEPARATED THE TRIBE OF LEVI. “This refers back to the first subject. At that time, in the first year of your departure from Egypt when you sinned by worshipping the calf and the sons of Levi did not sin, G-d separated them from you.” This is Rashi’s language. And if so, he is stating that from that time the sons of Levi were separated before Him, blessed be He [but only in thought], for He did not separate them in fact until the second year in the second month [after the first census which took place on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt]! (Numbers 1:1.)  Or it may be that he is alluding to what he said to them [at the affair of the calf], Consecrate yourselves today to the Eternal, (Exodus 32:29.)  for thereby you dedicate yourselves to the service of priests and Levites. The correct interpretation, it appears to me, is that the expression at that time means that the second [giving of the Tablets] was like the first. For, from the time He said to Moses Hew thee two Tablets of stone, (Ibid., 34:1.)  He was reconciled with Israel, and Moses was instructed regarding the construction of the Tabernacle. Then He was reconciled also with Aaron, and Moses was commanded, and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons — to sanctify him — that he may minister unto Me in the priest’s office, (Ibid., 28:4. The phrase to sanctify him is found there in Verse 3.)  and He further commanded him concerning the initiation [of the priests]. Therefore he said [here in Verse 6] that Eleazar ministered in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, since their anointing was to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. (Ibid., 40:15.)  Moses regarded the separation of the entire tribe [of Levi — priests and Levites] as one matter [therefore he said here, At that time — when the second Tablets were given, even though only the priests were formally separated, it was equivalent to a designation of the entire tribe, with the formal designation of the Levites to come after the first census], for, from that day on it was [resolved] before Him that His tribe be wholly given unto Him (Numbers 8:16.)  to perform the service of the Tabernacle. Or perhaps he is saying that the tribe of Levi was separated at that time for the priests to be [chosen] from them, for they [i.e., the priests] also carried the ark. (The verse before us states: At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark … Now, according to the interpretation that the verse means that the tribe of Levi was separated to be the source of the priests, rather than as a special tribe in its entirety, the following question arises: The verse indicates that the priests [derived from the tribe of Levi] were to carry the ark, but it is known that the Levites, not the priests, carried the ark (Numbers 7:9). Ramban answers that the priests, too, were permitted to carry the ark. See “The Commandments.” Vol. I, pp. 43-44, for a fuller discussion on this subject.)  And so it is said, and he [Moses] delivered it [the Torah] unto the priests the sons of Levi; that bore the ark of the covenant of the Eternal, (Further, 31:9.)  and they [the priests] are the ones who minister to G-d and bless in His Name [as the verse before us concludes]. And the meaning of the expression unto this day [at the end of this verse] is that it refers [back] to Eleazar’s ministering in the priest’s office [in Aaron’s stead — mentioned in Verse 6], as if saying: “then He separated them [the priests] to minister to Him, and it [so] was to this day” [i.e., the time when Moses spoke these words, that Eleazar served as High Priest]. (Ramban’s reasoning is as follows: Since we have now explained the verse, At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi (Verse 8) as referring to the designating of the priests, from the tribe of Levi, to minister in the Tabernacle, why does the verse conclude with the expression, unto this day, since on “this day,” when Moses spoke these words, the whole tribe of Levi was already elevated to its exalted position? But if it refers back to Eleazar’s office as High Priest (mentioned in Verse 6) that it was so “unto this day,” there is of course no difficulty as to why the Levites are not mentioned here.) "
31,9,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:24:1,"AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED WRITING [THE WORDS OF THIS LAW]. The meaning thereof is that, at first, he wrote the Law and delivered it unto the priests as is stated above, (Above, Verse 9.)  but he did not tell them where they were to put it. Afterwards he was commanded concerning this Song — he wrote it and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  that same day, and thus added it to the Law. And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing everything in the Book of the Law, then he commanded the priests, Take this Book of the Law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d, (Verse 26.)  meaning that it should remain in the ark at the side [of the Tablets], for henceforth they would not even touch it to add [thereto] or to diminish [from it]. This is the sense of the verse, And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing [the words of this Law in a book] until they were completed. Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [Seder] V’zoth Habrachah (Further, Chapter 33.)  was [written] earlier, and its proper place is above as it is stated And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel. (Above, Verse 1. Ibn Ezra holds that at the time when he informed them of his impending death, he also blessed them, as recorded in Seder V’zoth Habrachah.)  It is possible that after he wrote the Song and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  one by one according to their tribes as he had them brought before him to the House of Learning, he wrote it in the Book of the Law and commanded the priests Take this Book of the Law, (Verse 26.)  meaning that the Song too, should remain in the ark with the Law, for it is part of the Law since it is there as a testimony. Then Moses told them to assemble before him again — all the elders of the tribes and the officers (See further, Verse 28.)  — and that the people should join them, for so it is stated at the end, And Moses came and spoke all the words of this Song in the ears of the people. (Further, 32:44.)  Now the priests did so and they assembled the entire people before him and he called heaven and earth to witness against them in assembly (Thus in addition to teaching the Song to the individual tribes, he now taught it again in an assembly of the entire people.)  in the hearing of the priests and all the people. Then G-d, blessed be He, told him Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim. (Ibid., Verse 49.)  This he was bound to do immediately, and so he stood up and blessed them: ‘V’zoth Habrachah’ (And this is the blessing). (Ibid., 33:1.)  He then wrote it at the end of the book which he gave to the priests. Then the priests did as he commanded them — they placed the complete book by the side of the ark of the covenant. (In accordance with Ramban’s interpretation at the beginning of the verse that the Law was placed “in the ark at the side [of the Tablets]” the language here too must mean: “[inside] by the side of the ark of the covenant.” This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir (Baba Bathra 14a).)  Thus everything took place in the order stated in the Torah. (See a similar approach of Ramban in Leviticus 8:2 (Vol. III, p. 91-93).)  Ha’azinu"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim.

Allein ausnahmsweise bei besonders hervorragender Gelegenheit wurde sie von Priestern getragen. So beim Durchzug durch den Jordan (Josua 3, 3 f.), bei der Umschreitung Jericho׳s (daselbst 6, 6) und bei der endlichen Einbringung derselben in das Allerheiligste des von Salomo erbauten Tempels (Kön, I. 8, 3; siehe Sota 33b). Auch scheint der Moment der ersten Übergabe der Schrift der Tora an die Priester und Ältesten ein solcher gewesen zu sein, für welchen die כהנים mit dem ארון ברית ד׳ zu erscheinen hatten, und dies um so mehr, da sich daran eine Aufgabe knüpft, deren Ausführung einer Zeit angehörte, in welcher die Bundeslade und mit ihr auch diese von Mosche gefertigte Schrift (V. 26) bereits eine von Gott erwählte Stätte hatte, wo sie unter Obhut der Priester und nicht mehr in Händen der Leviten war. Dies erklärt auch den Wechsel der Ausdrücke. Hier heißt es: אל הכהנים בני לוי הנשאים וגו׳, sie trugen nur in dem Augenblick die Lade. V. 25 heißen aber die Leviten נשאי ארון וגו׳, sie waren die ständigen Träger derselben. Dass dieser Moment Sota 33b nicht mit aufgeführt ist, dürfte sich daraus erklären, daß dieses Erscheinen mit der Lade nur für den Augenblick und kein Tragen von Ort zu Ort war, das eigentlich zu dem Beruf der Leviten gehörte.

31,9,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:9,"Moses wrote this Torah, the Torah we have today, and he gave it to the priests, sons of Levi, who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord; and he gave it to all the elders of Israel. They would later copy from this Torah, while the original would remain alongside the Tablets of the Covenant."
31,9,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:9:1","אל הכהנים בני לוי הנושאים את הארון וגו, “to the priests the members of the tribe of Levi, who were charged with carrying the Holy Ark, etc.” Even though it was the Levites who carried the Holy Ark, and not the priests, (Numbers 7,8) as soon as Moses had died, the priests carried the Holy Ark when the Israelites were in the process of crossing the river Jordan. (Compare Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 33). They did so again when the people marched around Jericho and when they returned the Ark to its place in the days of King Solomon, when it was transferred from the Tabernacle. (Kings I 8,6) An alternate interpretation: seeing that it was the priests who assigned the transportation of the Ark to the Levites, as spelled out in Numbers 4,5, they could have been described as the prime movers. They were referred to there as נושאי הארון, “the carriers of the Ark.”"
31,10,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:10:1,"מקץ שבע שנים AT THE END OF EVERY SEVEN YEARS [AT THE APPOINTED SEASON OF THE SHEMITTAH YEAR]  — This means in the first year of the new Shemittah-period — in the eighth year (Sotah 41a). But why does Scripture call it the “Shemittah-year”, which name usually implies the seventh year? Because the law of the “seventh year” still applies to it, viz., in connection with the harvest of the seventh year’s produce that actually goes forth into (takes place in) the year following the seventh year (the eighth year) (Rosh Hashanah 12b; cf. Rashi on Exodus 34:21)."
31,10,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:10:1,AT THE END OF EVERY SEVEN YEARS. At the beginning of the year. (According to I.E. the word mi-ketz (at the end) sometimes means at the beginning. See I.E. on Deut. 15:1. I.E. interprets thus because the seventh year was to be a year of Torah study. He felt that the public reading of the Torah was not the climax of this year but the initiation of a year of Torah study.) 
31,10,Mishnah,Mishnah Sotah 7:8,"How is the portion of the Torah that is read by the king recited at the assembly, when all the Jewish people would assemble? At the conclusion of the first day of the festival of Sukkot, on the eighth, after the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year, they make a wooden platform for the king in the Temple courtyard, and he sits on it, as it is stated: “At the end of every seven years, in the Festival of the Sabbatical Year” (Deuteronomy 31:10). The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and gives it to the head of the synagogue that stands on the Temple Mount. And the head of the synagogue gives it to the deputy High Priest, and the deputy High Priest gives it to the High Priest, and the High priest gives it to the king. And the king stands, and receives the Torah scroll, and reads from it while sitting. King Agrippa arose, and received the Torah scroll, and read from it while standing, and the Sages praised him for this. And when Agrippa arrived at the verse in the portion read by the king that states: “You may not appoint a foreigner over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15), tears flowed from his eyes, because he was a descendant of the house of Herod and was not of Jewish origin. The entire nation said to him: Fear not, Agrippa. You are our brother, you are our brother. And the king reads from the beginning of Deuteronomy, from the verse that states: “And these are the words” (Deuteronomy 1:1), until the words: “Hear, O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4). And he then reads the sections beginning with: “Hear, O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), “And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken” (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), “You shall tithe” (Deuteronomy 14:22–29), “When you have made an end of the tithing” (Deuteronomy 26:12–15), and the passage concerning the appointment of a king (Deuteronomy 17:14–20), and the blessings and curses (Deuteronomy 28), until he finishes the entire portion. The same blessings that the High Priest recites on Yom Kippur, the king recites at this ceremony, but he delivers a blessing concerning the Festivals in place of the blessing concerning forgiveness for iniquity."

King Agrippa was accustomed to accept it while standing and would also read it while standing, and the Rabbis praised him for this act, and when he would reach the passage (Deut. 17, 15) Thou mayest not set over thee a stranger who is not thy brother, tears would roll down from his eyes.

31,10,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 26:12:1,"כי תכלה לעשר את כל מעשר תבואתך בשנה השלישת WHEN THOU HAST FINISHED TITHING ALL THE TITHES OF THY INCREASE IN THE THIRD YEAR — this means: when you have finished the setting apart of the tithes of the third year. It (Scripture) has fixed the time for removing the tithes from the house (ביעור) and the confession regarding their proper disposition (ודוי) for the eve of the Passover festival of the fourth year, because it is stated, (Deuteronomy 14:28) “At the end (מקצה) of three years thou shall bring forth [all the tithe of thy increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates]”. It uses here (in the verse just quoted) the words “at the end of” (מקצה) and it states further (Deuteronomy 31:10—11): “At the end of every seven years … [in the festival of Tabernacles, … thou shalt read this law before Israel]” with reference to the law of “public assembly”, in order to suggest an analogy. How is it in the case further on? It takes place at a festival period as stated! So, too, here, the rite takes place at a festival period. If so, one might argue: What is the case there? It takes place on the festival of Tabernacles; so, too, here the rite takes place on Tabernacles! Scripture, however, states here: When thou hast finished tithing the tithes of the third year, which thus points to a festival on which all tithes are finished and this is the Passover festival, for there are many trees the fruits of which are gathered after Tabernacles, and consequently the setting apart of tithes of the third year is at an end on Passover of the fourth year. And whoever had delayed his tithes until then Scripture declares him bound to clear them out by that time from his house (cf. Sifrei Devarim 302; Talmud Yerushalmi Maaser Sheni 5:6)."
31,10,Commentary,"JPS 1985 Footnotes, Deuteronomy 31:3",See note at 15.1.
31,10,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 9:4","The Sabbatical year does not nullify debts until its conclusion. [This is derived as follows: Deuteronomy 15:1-2] states: ""At the end of seven years, you shall effect a remission. This is the matter of the remission."" And [Deuteronomy 31:10] states: (With regard to the Hakhel ceremony. The interrelation of these verses has its source in the Sifri.)  ""At the end of seven years, at the time of the Sabbatical year, during the holiday of Sukkot."" Just as in that instance, [the event takes place] after the seven [years], so too, the nullification of the debts takes place after the seven [years]. Therefore if one lent money to a colleague in the Sabbatical year itself, he may demand payment of his debt for the entire year. (According to other authorities, although the debt is not remitted until the end of the Sabbatical year, from the beginning of the Sabbatical year, the creditor is forbidden to demand payment. See Shulchan Aruch HaRav, loc. cit. 36.)  When the sun sets on the night of Rosh HaShanah of the eighth year, (I.e., the sunset marking the advent of Rosh HaShanah.)  the debt is nullified. (Because it is forbidden to demand its payment (Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.).) "
31,10,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 3","“… at the end of seven years, at the time of the Shmitta [sabbatical or release] year, during the festival of Succot ….” (Devarim, 31:10) It is said in the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah, 12b), “What does the festival of Succot have to do with the Shmitta [seventh] year? Succot, following Rosh Hashanah, is already in the eighth year. Yet all produce where you did not bring a third thereof in the seventh year, you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh.” This is according to the verse (Tehilim, 115:16), “The heavens are the heavens of God, and the earth was given to man.” This is just the way it seems. Yet King David said (Tehilim, 135:6), “all that God desired, He did, in the heavens and the earth.” It is well-known that all the actions of man, even though the power of choice was given to man, are something as insignificant as a peel of garlic. This is why we say on the first day of the week (Sunday) (while reciting the daily Levitical songs in the morning service), “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.” The point of Shabbat is to know that man has no real power, for the thirty-nine forms of work created in the world with which man may do all he wants are all prohibited on Shabbat. Yet when the weekdays start, and work is again permitted, God forbid that man may say, “my strength and the power of my hands have gotten me this wealth” (Devarim, 8:17). Therefore our sages established that we say immediately after Shabbat, “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.” It is similarly so with the seventh Shmitta year that the Torah commanded, which makes it known to us that the earth is God’s and all its fullness. Then when the eighth year comes, plowing and sowing are again permitted in order that we can reap from the land without say, God forbid, “my strength and the power of my hands have gained me this wealth.” This is why with produce that a third was not brought as a tithe in the seventh year, “you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh,” in order to remember that “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.”"
31,10,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Leviticus 19:2:1","קדושים תהיו, ”you shall be holy;” Our sages in Torat Kohanim state that this was one of the portions of the Torah which was read out in public once every seven years on Sukkot on the occasion of “hakhel,” the public reading of the Torah by the King before the assembled nation, men women and children (compare Deuteronomy 31,10, the penultimate of the 613 commandments). The reason was that it contains so many of the basic laws of the Torah, such as the laws about offering personal voluntary peace-offerings, the penalty for disregarding the laws abut incest and sexual mores. We must understand that holiness can only develop as a result of abstaining from all the items that the Torah has described as an abomination in the eyes of Hashem.
    Nachmanides writes that he has examined the wording in his edition of the Torat Kohanim, and has not found anything spelled out there about being especially פרוש, i.e. keeping one’s distance from the subject covered by sexual mores, but that we are to be generally פרושים, discreet, and discriminating in our conduct, as a result of which holiness will develop. [My edition of the Torat Kohanim, printed in Torah Shleymah bears out what Nachmanides writes. Ed.] G’d is quoted as saying: “just as I keep apart (from contact with what is unbecoming, so shall you keep yourself apart from contact with matters that are unbecoming for you.” It follows that the subject of פרישות includes abstaining and keeping one’s distance from all the subject matter mentioned in the Talmud as subject to such warnings by our sages. 
    Nachmanides uses as an example the fact that whereas on the one hand, the Torah has permitted sexual intercourse, it imposed limitations with whom such sexual intercourse may be indulged in, similarly, it has also permitted the eating of foods which are palatable and non poisonous, but has imposed limitations in forbidding Jews foods which gentiles clearly enjoy without apparent harmful effects. Holiness, if aspired to, is therefore possible by imposing upon oneself restrictions and not considering everything that has not been expressly forbidden as permitted, but to train oneself to be moderate in enjoying the material attractions the world has to offer. These attractions may be enjoyed when they are intended to make the performance of a commandment more meaningful both esthetically and artistically, for instance. A person intent on attaining a level of holiness would not seek out such attractions for their own sake. [When someone loves silver trinkets and collects them, this does not further his path to attaining holiness, although he did not do something forbidden. If, however, he indulges his whim by buying beautiful ethrog boxes, mezuzah housings, kiddush cups, etc., then he may at one and the same time indulge his sense of what is esthetically beautiful, and come closer to attaining degree of holiness.
    Our sages, in limiting the frequency of marital relations with one’s wife even, suggested that a Torah scholar limit himself to such marital intercourse once a week, while an ordinary uneducated worker is allowed to indulge in such activity more often. (Compare Chagigah 18, Berachot, 22 and other places in the Talmud) Nachmanides points out that it is possible not to violate a single one of the 613 commandments in the Torah and still not only to remain far from “holy,” but to continue to be a gross and uncouth individual, eating to excess, drinking to excess, indulging in legally permitted sex at every opportunity, etc.
    If the ideal of a Torah personality could be the result of merely not violating any of the 613 commandments, Moses would not have had to write in Deut. 6,18 ועשית הישר והטוב בעיני ה', “do what is fair and good in the eyes of Hashem.” In halachic parlance, our approach to life should be to act לפנים משורת הדין, “to stay well within what is allowable legally.” The meaning of the dictate in our verse therefore is:

And it shall be when you have gone over the Yarden, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day in mount ῾Eval, and thou shalt cover them with plaster.

And each of these is a positive, time-bound mitzva, and yet women are obligated in them. And furthermore, one can raise a difficulty as follows: But there are the mitzvot of Torah study (Deuteronomy 6:7), procreation (Genesis 1:28), and redemption of the firstborn (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and yet women are exempt from them."

The Gemara asks: From where are these matters derived, that the years of produce follow the first third of their growth? Rav Asi said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some determined that this statement was said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The verse states: “At the end of every seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the festival of Sukkot” (Deuteronomy 31:10). What is the purpose of the Sabbatical Year being mentioned with the festival of Sukkot? The festival of Sukkot is already the eighth year."

Therefore, the Merciful One writes: “The Sabbatical Year.”"
31,10,Halakhah,"The Sabbath Epistle, First Gate; On the Beginning of the Year 20","We also find written ( Ibn Ezra now proceeds to show that for some matters the year begins with the month of Tishre. Here he seems to be countering the Karites, who did not accept the first of Tishre as Rosh haShana. The Karites argued that there is no Scriptural basis for the first of Tishre being anything other than a day when work is forbidden (Leviticus 23:23–25) and special sacrifices are offered (Numbers 29: 1–5). The Karites began the year for all religious matters with the first of Nisan.)  with regard to Tabernacles “at the turn of the year” (Exodus 34:22), and also “at the departure of the year” (ibid. 23:16). Now the same day when one year ends a new year begins. We also find that God instructed us in a law of Haqhel, when the entire Torah is read during the holiday of Tabernacles of a Sabbatical year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). There it is written “in order that they may learn” (ibid. 31:12). It is not likely that this took place after half a year. ( Thus, Haqhel certainly took place at the beginning of a Sabbatical year, indicating that a Sabbatical year began around the time of Tabernacles.)  Do not be perplexed by the word “At an end (miqqez) of seven years” (ibid. 31:10), ( The verse concerning Haqhel reads: “At the end of seven years, in the time of the Sabbatical year, on the holiday of Tabernacles,” which seems to indicate that the celebration of Haqhel took place at the conclusion of the Sabbatical year and the beginning of the eighth year.)  for we similarly find “At an end (miqqez) of seven years you shall send forth, each man his brother” (Jeremiah 34:14). ( We know that servants were set free after six years (Exodus 21:2). Thus “miqqez” must here refer to the beginning of the seventh year. Similarly for Haqhel, the word “miqqez” means “beginning” rather than “end.”)  For each thing has two edges, a front edge and a back edge. The Sabbatical year began with Tishre, ( Here Ibn Ezra refutes the Karites who began the Sabbatical year with Nisan. (See Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Leviticus 25:20.))  which is the seventh month, since then the half year of planting began. Thus it states regarding the Sabbatical year “do not plant” (Leviticus 25:4), and “You shall plant on the eighth year” (ibid. 25:22). "
31,10,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:10:1-2","מקץ שבע שנים במועד שנת השמטה בחג הסוכות, “at the end of seven years, at the time of the Sabbatical year, on the festival of Tabernacles;” this is a reference to the commandment known as הקהל, “assembly.” The word מקץ means “at the end.” Wherever we encounter the expression מקץ it means “at the end.” [I suppose the reason that our author tells us this is that the preposition” מ in front of the word קץ might have suggested a different meaning. Ed.] The first time we encounter the word in Genesis 6,13 it also means “end.” In our instance, the Torah refers to the end of the Shemittah year (the year concluded 2 weeks before the festival of Tabernacles). In other words, “after that year has passed completely.” In actual fact the commandment is observed during the eighth year during the intermediate days of the Sukkot festival. When we have a different verse in which the word מקץ is also used in connection with the year when the Shemittah is being observed, (Deut. 15,1), the meaning is that the duty to relinquish overdue loans falls due on the last day of that year by sunset (Erchin 28). If the Torah there uses the term בשנת השמטה, it means: “while the Shemittah year is still in force.” Although in both instances the word מקץ means “at the end” [as opposed to Ibn Ezra. Ed.], here it means “after the end,” whereas in Deut. 15,1 it means “just before the end.” If you will analyse the mystical dimension of the commandment of הקהל, you will find that just as the Shemittah year itself is an allusion to the 7th millennium during which our universe will revert to chaos, so the commandment of הקהל, which commences after completion of the seventh year alludes to the word לעשות in Genesis 2,4 which follows the report of the conclusion of the seven days of creation after the Torah had introduced the concept of the Sabbath. We also find in Psalms 92, the hymn dedicated by David to the Sabbath, that he speaks about the righteous who will flourish like the palm tree. (presumably after the seventh millennium) I have already dealt with the meaning of that psalm in connection with Genesis 2,2. The mystical dimension of the commandment of hakhel is that all people who exist at that time are called to appear before the Lord, the King of the universe. This is why this commandment had to be performed by the king. He represented the King in the celestial spheres. He had to read from the Torah (not the High Priest). This is reflected in the statement of the scholars of the Kabbalah who posit that before proceeding with the creation of the universe the Lord consulted His blueprint, i.e. the Torah.  Another reason for reading from the Torah on that occasion was to remind the people that without Torah the universe cannot endure, just as it could not have been created without it. The reason the site for the fulfillment of the commandment is described as במקום אשר יבחר, “the place which the Lord will choose,” is that the Temple-site was the place whence the universe started being created. This is the meaning of Psalms 50,2: “for from Zion, perfect in beauty, G’d appeared.” As the sages say in Yuma 54: “the world was perfected starting with Zion.”"

31,12,Quoting Commentary,English Explanation of Mishnah Sotah 7:8:1,"Introduction
Deuteronomy 31:10-12 states, “Every seventh year, at the time of the sabbatical year, at Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Teaching aloud in the presence of all Israel.  Gather the people men, women, children and the strangers in your communities that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching.”
Our mishnah discusses how this ceremony, which is called by the rabbis “Gathering”, was performed.  The ceremony was performed on the holiday of Sukkot which immediately followed the end of the sabbatical year."
31,10,Quoting Commentary,English Explanation of Mishnah Sotah 7:8:2,"How was the procedure in connection with the portion read by the king? At the conclusion of the first day of the festival ( in the eighth [year], at the end of the seventh year, they erect a wooden platform in the Temple court, and he sits upon it, as it is said, “At the end of seven years, in the set time” etc (Deuteronomy 31:10).  The mishnah teaches that they erected a wooden platform in the Temple so that the king can be heard when he reads the portions of Deuteronomy to the people."
31,13,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:2","It is a positive mitzva to assemble all of Israel – men, women, and children – on Sukkot at the end of each Shemita year, during their pilgrimage to the Temple. Sections of the Torah that encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance are then read to them, as it is written: And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year, at the time of the Shemita year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Torah aloud in the presence of all Israel. Assemble (Hak’hel) the people – men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities – that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Torah. Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere the Lord your God as long as they live, in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. (Devarim 31:10-13)"
31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:3:2","Hak’hel took place on Sukkot right after the Shemita year: “Every seventh year, at the time of the Shemita year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God” (Devarim 31:10-11). Based on the phrase “when all Israel comes,” the Sages extrapolate that the verse refers to the beginning of the festival, as that was when everyone came to Jerusalem (Sota 41a). However, the Sages did not want to hold the assembly on the first day of the festival, because that day is Yom Tov, and it would be forbidden to erect the platform on which the king stood. Putting it up before the festival was not a good option either, because that would have led to crowding in the Temple courtyard when everyone came to offer sacrifices. Therefore, Hak’hel was postponed until right after the first Yom Tov (Rashi). Alternatively, it can be derived from the verse’s use of the word “ba-mo’ed” (translated above “at the time”), which can be understood to mean “in the festival,” that Hak’hel took place in the middle of the festival, not at the very beginning (Tosafot)."
31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:5:3","All agree that there is no way to fulfill the mitzva of Hak’hel nowadays, because it is linked to the mitzva of making a pilgrimage to the Temple for the festival, as it is written: “At the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose” (Devarim 31:10-11). As long as the Temple is in ruins and it is impossible to offer the festival sacrifices, the mitzva of making the pilgrimage does not apply (Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim 1:16). The Sages derived this from a gezera shava, as the Torah speaks of “appearing” in the context of both mitzvot (Ḥagiga 3a). Rambam codifies this succinctly: “All who are exempt from the pilgrimage are exempt from Hak’hel, except for women and children…” (MT, op. cit. 3:2)."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

The mishna notes an additional difference between the obligations of men and women in the performance of mitzvot: With regard to all positive, time-bound mitzvot, i.e., those which must be performed at specific times, men are obligated to perform them and women are exempt. And with regard to all positive mitzvot that are not time bound, both men and women are obligated to perform them.

According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

In der Münchener Handschrift und ebenso im Jalkut zu Deut. 31, 10 steht פרשת המלך nach ברכות וקללות; danach schloß die Toravorlesung mit פרשת המלך. Zu dieser La. passen besser die Worte עד שגומר כל הפרשה, als zur vorliegenden, und dieser Text lag auch Raschi und ברטנורה vor (vgl. הגהות רש״ש gegen תוספות י״ט)."

31,10,Quoting Commentary,"Chizkuni, Exodus 12:2:5","ראש חדשים, the beginning of a count of months but not the beginning of the counting of years. The 7 annual sh’mittah cycle, the 49 year Jubilee year cycle, the period of planting i.e. the seasons and harvesting, are all not regulated by the lunar calendar but by the solar calendar, i.e. relying on summer, winter, fall and spring. This has been spelled out in the Torah in Deut. 31,10: “at the conclusion of seven years, during the season of when the year of sh’mittah, 'release’ begins during the festival of sukkot.”If the first day in the month of Nissan had been intended to serve as the first day of the year, why did the Torah not command us to read the relevant passage on the holiday of Passover? This would have taught us that the month of Nissan was also the first month of the year! If the Torah describes the festival of Sukkot as occurring at the end of the year, the festival of Passover which occurs before any harvest season, cannot possibly be at the beginning of the year. Clearly, the beginning of the year occurs near the festival of Sukkot."
31,10,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:10:1","מקץ שבע שנים, “at the end of (every) seven years;” at the beginning of the eight’s year. [The sh’mittah year.

31,10,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:10:2","במועד שנת השמטה, “on the feast of Sukkot;” seeing that this year is the first year in the new sh’mittah cycle which comprises seven years, why does the Torah refer to that year as שנת השמטה, the year of the sh’mittah? The reason is that many of the restrictions that applied during the previous year were still in force, such as the residue of the “harvest” of the previous year. (Compare Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah folio 12. It is stated there that any crop which had completed one third of its growth before the end of the sh’mittah year was still considered as subject to the regulations applicable during that year.)"
31,10,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Sotah 7:8:1,"[בשמיני] – In the eight year of the Sabbatical year–Shemittah that just passed, which is at the conclusion of this seventh year at the conclusion of the first day of Yom Tov (i.e., Sukkot), as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:10): “On the Feast of Booths.” I hear–learn even on the last day of Yom Tov of the holiday, the inference teaches us (Deuteronomy 31:11): “When all Israel comes to appear [before the LORD your God],”from the beginning of the Intermediate Days [of the Festival]."

31,10,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Maaser Sheni 5:6:1,"ערב יום טוב הראשון של פסח וכו' – As it is written (Deuteronomy 14:28): “Every third year you shall bring out the full tithe of the yield of that year, [but leave it in your settlements],” and it states further on (Deuteronomy 31:10): “ Every seventh year, the year set for remission, at the Feast of Booths.” Just as there (Deuteronomy 31:10), it is speaking of a Festival, so here (Deuteronomy 14:28) too, it speaks of a Festival. If just as there (Deuteronomy 31:10), the Festival of Booths, so here (Deuteronomy 14:28) too, the Festival of Booths, as the inference teaches us, (Deuteronomy 26:12): “When you have set aside in full the tenth part of your yield…,” the Festival in which all the Tithes are completed. One can say that this is Passover, where the produce of the third year is not completed to be harvested completely until the Passover of the fourth year comes, and similarly, from the sixth year, until the Passover of the seventh year comes."
31,12,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Pesach, Festival Prayers 12","People are accustomed to reading the Song of Songs on the Festival of Matzot because it speaks about the salvation from Egypt, which is the beginning of the subjugation of Israel and their first redemption. As it is stated (Song of Songs 1:9), ""To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots."" And they are also accustomed to read Ruth on the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), because it is written in it (Ruth 1:22), ""at the beginning of the barley harvest"" - and [Shavuot] is the the time of the harvest. And there is another reason: Because our ancestors only accepted the Torah and entered the covenant through circumcision, immersion and the sprinkling of blood [at that time], as it is found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz; and Ruth also converted, as it is stated (Ruth 1:16), ""for where you go, I shall go."" And from the answer of Ruth, we know what Noami said to her. As she said to her, ""It is prohibited for us [to go beyond] the Shabbat perimeter."" [She answered,] ""Where you go, I shall go"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Isolation [with a stranger of the opposite sex] is forbidden to us."" ""Where you lodge, I shall lodge"" (Ruth 1:16). ""We are commanded to observe six hundred and thirteen commandments."" ""Your people are my people"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us."" ""Your God is my God"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Four types of capital punishment were handed over to the court."" ""Where you die, I shall die"" (Ruth 1:17). ""Two burial grounds were set up for the court, one for those burnt and stoned and another for those executed and strangled."" ""And there I shall be buried"" (Ruth 1:17). So is it found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz (Yevamot 47b). And we are hence accustomed to reading Ruth on  the Holiday of Weeks. And also on the Festival of Shemini Atzeret (Assembly of the Eighth), it is customary to read Ecclesiastes, because in it, it is written (Ecclesiastes 11:1), ""Distribute portions to seven or even to eight"" - these [correspond to] the seven days of the Festival (Sukkot) and the Festival of the Assembly of the Eighth. I mean to say, because it is the holiday of the reaping, to warn about the tithes and the priestly tithes and the pledges, such that they not transgress, ""you shall not delay,"" [past] the three festivals. And there is another reason - because King Shlomo said it on the Festival (Sukkot) during the assembly (hakhel). As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:10-12), ""at the appointed time of the year of remission, during the Sukkot festival;  When all of Israel comes to be seen, etc. Assemble (Hakhel) the people; the men and the women and the infants, etc."" And it is [also] written (I Kings 8:2), ""they assembled before King Shlomo in the month of Etanim during the festival, etc."" So he said it then in the assembly, to rebuke Israel. Hence it is fit to say it during [this] festival. All of this was written by Ibn HaYarchi (R. Avraham ben Natan). And they said in Tractate Soferim (14:3), ""One who reads from Ruth, the Song of Songs, Lamentations and from the Scroll of Esther must [recite the blessing that concludes], 'concerning the reading of the Megillah' - even though it is included in the Writings. One who reads from the Writings must recite, 'Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, [who has sanctified us with Your commandments and has commanded us] to read in the Holy Writings.'""

31,11,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 2:1","Women and servants are exempt from the obligation to appear before God on festivals. All men are obligated to appear with the exception of a deaf person, a mute, one who is emotionally or intellectually incapable of controlling himself, a minor, a blind person, one who is limp, one who is impure, one who is uncircumcised, and similarly, one who is old, sick, very dainty and spoiled to the extent they cannot ascend by foot. All of these eleven persons are exempt. All other men are obligated to appear before God. To explain these categories in greater detail: A deaf person is exempt even if he can speak. Even if he is deaf in only one ear, he is exempt from appearing. Similarly, one who is blind in one eye or limp in one leg, is exempt. A mute even though he hears is exempt. A tumtum and an androgynus are exempt, because there is a doubt whether they are female. A person who is half-servant and half-free is exempt, because of the side of him that is a servant. What is the source that all the above are exempt from appearing before God? Exodus 23:17 states: ""All of your males shall appear""; this excludes women. And any positive commandment for which women are not obligated, servants are not obligated. Moreover, Deuteronomy 31:11 ""When all Israel come to appear""; this excludes servants. The phrase ""When all Israel come to appear"" implies that just as they come to appear before God, so too, they come to see the glory of His holiness and the house where His presence rests. Thus it excludes a blind person who cannot see; he is exempt even if only one eye is blinded, because his sight is not perfect. That passage continues: ""So that they will hear."" This excludes one whose hearing is not perfect. And it states: ""So that they will learn."" This excludes one who does not speak, because everyone who is obligated to learn is also obligated to teach. Exodus 34:24 states: ""When you ascend to appear before the presence of God."" The command is directed to one who can ascend by foot and thus excludes one who is limp, old, sick, or very dainty. And we have already explained in Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash that a person who is impure is not fit to enter the Temple. And one is uncircumcised is loathsome like one who is impure."
31,11,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 3:1","It is a positive commandment to gather together the entire Jewish people - men, women, and children - after every Sabbatical year when they ascend for the pilgrimage holiday and to read so that they hear passages from the Torah that encourage them to perfom mitzvot and strengthem them in the true faith, as Deuteronomy 31:10-12 states: ""At the end of a seven-year period, at the time of the Sabbatial year on the Sukkot holiday when all Israel come to appear... gather the nation, the men, the women, the children, and your stranger in your gates...."""
31,11,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 3:2","All of those who are exempt from the mitzvah of appearing before God are exempt from the mitzvah of hakhel with the exception of women, children, and those uncircumcised. One who is ritually impure is, by contrast, exempt from the mitzvah of Hakhel, as implied by the phrase ""When all Israel come...,"" for such a person is not fit to come to the Temple. It is clear that a tumtum and an androgynus are obligated, for women are obligated."
31,11,Talmud,Kiddushin 34b:3,"The Gemara answers: It was necessary for the verse to teach the halakha in this case as well, as it might enter your mind to say: Derive a verbal analogy with regard to appearance, where the verse states: Three times in the year all of your males shall appear,” from the appearance stated with regard to the mitzva of assembly, about which the verse states: “When all of Israel come to appear before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 31:11). One would then say that just as women are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, so too they should be obligated to appear on a pilgrimage Festival. It is therefore necessary for the Torah to state explicitly that women are exempt from the mitzva of appearance on a pilgrimage Festival."
31,11,Talmud,Sotah 41a:25,"And if the Merciful One had written only: “In the festival of Sukkot,” I would have said that it could refer even to the last day of the Festival. Therefore, the Merciful One also writes: “When all Israel comes” (Deuteronomy 31:11),"
31,11,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Third Treatise on Service of God 3:18","It sometimes also happens that an individual falls short in some duties and exceeds in others. The intellectual stimulus varies in different individuals in accordance with their capacity of recognition. But the urge of the Torah is not subject to variation. Its form is the same for the child, the youth, one advanced in years and the old man, the wise and the foolish, even though the resulting practice varies in different classes of individuals. And so Scripture says in regard to the all encompassing character of the instruction of the Torah for all the people, ""Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and the stranger that is within your gate, (that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the L-ord your G-d . . .)"" (Devarim 31:12). Further, it is said, "". . . you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing."" (Devarim 31:11). "
31,11,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Vaetchanan, Torah Ohr 3","The Arizal explains the reason that the Torah (Deut. 20,16) has demanded that the Jewish people kill every member of these seven Canaanite nations: לא תחיה כל נשמה. When the Torah instructs us how to relate to other nations (such as שעיר, i.e. אדום, עמון, and מואב however), it only commanded (Deut. 2,9 et al) the Jewish people under Moses not to make war against those nations. The seven Canaanite nations represent seven קליפות, i.e. שבעה כלים שנשברו, negative aspects of the seven emanations which comprise what we called בנין, the constructive forces enabling the creation of a perfect physical universe. Although, as we explained in connection with the name ""Samael,"" even Satan had his root in something holy, i.e. א-ל, the spiritual decline of these descendants of the original Canaan, the cursed, was such that no vestige of sanctity was left in them. This meant automatically that no נשמה, spiritually elevated soul of theirs, would survive. The other three nations whose land G–d had promised as part of ארץ ישראל still retained vestiges of holiness. These were the קיני, קניזי and קדמוני, whose lands G–d had also promised Abraham (Genesis 15,19) when He promised us the Holy Land. These nations had their origin in the ""upper"" three emanations. The promise that we will inherit their lands in the future can be fulfilled when the last vestiges of sanctity will have vanished from these three nations. At such a time the commandment not to let a soul survive will also be applicable to those three nations. The Arizal wants to equate the three nations Edom, Ammon and Moab with the Keynee, Kenizi and Kadmoni respectively. The very names of these three nations allude to their having had a superior origin, שעיר alludes to Deut. 33,2, where G–d is portrayed as coming from Se-ir to give Israel the Torah. The name Moab means ""from the אב, ""the father,"" another allusion to the higher emanation חכמה, seat of undiluted holiness. The name Ammon is close to the word נועם, an allusion to the emanation בינה. שעיר is none other than אדום. The seven kings whom the Torah describes in the Torah (Genesis 36,31-39) as having ruled in the land of Edom before Israel had a king were not part of that nation. Apparently they had subjugated the country. This is why the Torah, when telling us that a particular king ruled over Edom, informs us of his country of origin. We are told in 2,20: והעמונים קראו להם זמזומים, that the Ammonites called the Refa-im Zamzumim. The word זמזום is derived from זמם, planned, thought out. In other words these רפאים had the ""superior"" emanation חכמה somewhere in their background. Their descendants were the mixed multitude who joined the Jewish people at the Exodus and converted to Judaism. This explains why they still had enough of a spark of sanctity in them to recognize the spiritual rejuvenation that was taking place at the time of the Exodus. On the other hand, anyone who plans something evil and uses his superior intelligence negatively, is similarly descended from them. The name סיחון, one of the kings of the Canaanite nations, suggests the word סייח, a young ass. The Hebrew word for donkey is חמור, the same letters as חומר, matter. The Canaanites were concerned with matter to the exclusion of the spirit. The name Og, king of Bashan, evokes similar considerations. The Arizal concludes that because the lands of these kingdoms were situated East of the river Jordan which symbolized the foundation of the feminine aspect in the emanations, these kingdoms could not have been subdued by anyone but Moses. Spiritually speaking, Moses represented the ""middle"" line between the left (feminine) side of the diagram of the emanations and the right (masculine) side. Moses was the carrier of the symbol of the Holy Covenant. He broke the tablets and salvaged the sanctity contained in them. When the Torah describes the defeat of the שני מלכי האמורי, ""the two kings of the Emorite"" (3,8), the first letters of these three words form the name משה. G–d said to Moses (2,31): ראה החילותי תת לפניך את סיחון, ""See, I have begun to hand over to you Sichon, etc."" This means that the patron of this kingdom, the שר, had been subjugated by Moses. The land of Israel is perceived as the ""feminine"" part of the union between the people of Israel and its land. Taking possession of the land of Israel, ביאת הארץ, is a euphemism for the union between Israel and its land as husband and wife. [I have rephrased some of this. Ed.]"

31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:6","The Sages ordained that the king read from the Torah to further dignify the event. However, even when there is no king, the king’s voice is weak, or he is a minor, the mitzva is not abrogated. Rather, a very prominent person does the reading – a prince, Kohen Gadol, or great Torah sage. (See: Tiferet Yisrael on Sota 7:8; Minḥat Ḥinukh §612; Ha’amek Davar on Devarim 31:11; R. Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim (Aderet), Zekher Le-Mikdash ch. 1.)"
31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:2:2","Hak’hel must be read in the holy tongue, the Hebrew of Scripture, as the verse states, “You shall read this Torah aloud” (Devarim 31:11) – as it is written. Those who do not understand the holy tongue are still required to listen, just as when the Torah was given on Sinai (Sota 32a; MT, op. cit. 3:5-6)."
31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:3:2","Hak’hel took place on Sukkot right after the Shemita year: “Every seventh year, at the time of the Shemita year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God” (Devarim 31:10-11). Based on the phrase “when all Israel comes,” the Sages extrapolate that the verse refers to the beginning of the festival, as that was when everyone came to Jerusalem (Sota 41a). However, the Sages did not want to hold the assembly on the first day of the festival, because that day is Yom Tov, and it would be forbidden to erect the platform on which the king stood. Putting it up before the festival was not a good option either, because that would have led to crowding in the Temple courtyard when everyone came to offer sacrifices. Therefore, Hak’hel was postponed until right after the first Yom Tov (Rashi). Alternatively, it can be derived from the verse’s use of the word “ba-mo’ed” (translated above “at the time”), which can be understood to mean “in the festival,” that Hak’hel took place in the middle of the festival, not at the very beginning (Tosafot)."
31,11,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:5:3","All agree that there is no way to fulfill the mitzva of Hak’hel nowadays, because it is linked to the mitzva of making a pilgrimage to the Temple for the festival, as it is written: “At the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose” (Devarim 31:10-11). As long as the Temple is in ruins and it is impossible to offer the festival sacrifices, the mitzva of making the pilgrimage does not apply (Peninei Halakha: Mo’adim 1:16). The Sages derived this from a gezera shava, as the Torah speaks of “appearing” in the context of both mitzvot (Ḥagiga 3a). Rambam codifies this succinctly: “All who are exempt from the pilgrimage are exempt from Hak’hel, except for women and children…” (MT, op. cit. 3:2)."

Rebbi Yose said, this implies that he may not send his appearance sacrifice by another person. Rebbi Shammai asked, or maybe the other way. Those afflicted by scabies or polyps (are exempt from appearance, since it is written when all of Israel comes. Rebbi Shammai turned around and said, Those afflicted by scabies or polyps) even though they cannot come with all of Israel, they can come by themselves (Since coming and bringing are mentioned in separate verses, they are separate obligations.

The assertion of the book of Kings that there was a perpetual state of war between the Northern and the Southern kingdoms in the time of Jeroboam (1K. 15:6) is interpreted as a war of words conducted in the House of Study. Another tradition (mentioned frequently but not undisputed) holds that nobody is allowed to sit in the Temple but a Davidic king (Pesaḥim5:10, Yoma3:2, Soṭah7:7; Babli Sanhedrin101b, Soṭah40a,41a, Yoma25a, Qiddušin78a, Tamid27a).

He made two golden calves and wrote on their hearts, “they will kill you.” He said, any king who will succeed me will look at them (The king would see the words engraved on the calves and understand that their purpose was to prevent people from observing the assembly in Jerusalem which would undermine his rule.) .

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

The Sages asserted that the custom of reading from the Torah on Shabbat and holidays was derived from Moses: “Moses instituted the practice for the Israelites of reading from the Torah on Shabbat and holidays and Rosh Hodesh.” (Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 4, 1, 75a.)  According to midrashic sources, the practice of reading the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays and during the Minhah service on Shabbat also originated in ancient times: “Thus the Prophets and the Elders instituted for them the custom of reading from the Torah on Shabbat, Mondays, and Thursdays.” (Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, ed. Horowitz-Rabin (Jerusalem, 5730), Be-shalah.)  A baraita in the Babylonian Talmud says it was instituted by the Prophets:"
31,13,Halakhah,"From Sinai to Ethiopia, Shulhan haOrit; The Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now, 3 Shabbat 9:5","The Babylonian Talmud notes that the Jews in Eretz Yisrael completed reading the entire Torah in three years, while in Babylonia, they completed it in one year. According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your stranger that is within your gates, so that they may hear, and so that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to perform all the words of this law.

But when the Ninth of Av falls on Shabbat, we fast on Sunday (i.e., the 10th of Menahem Av) for (see Talmud Megillah 5a) “for the advancement of punishment/retribution, we do not anticipate for ourselves.” And similarly, if the day of the festive offering of the visitors of the Temple on the festivals occurs on the Sabbath day, we off it on Sunday, as will be explained in Tractate Hagigah (Chapter 2 Mishnah 4). And if the Day of Assembly (see Deuteronomy 31:10-13 – which commands the Jewish people to assemble in the Temple courtyard once every seven years to hear the public reading of the book of Deuteronomy during the Festival of Sukkot following the Sabbatical year) falls on Shabbat, the Reading [of the Torah] will be on Sunday. And the time of the priests’ wood-offering, already the marking off of its time was advanced at the end of [Tractate] Taanit (see Chapter 4 Mishnah 5), that if one of those days was on Shabbat, the sacrifice would take place on Sunday. But we made all of these later for the time of our obligation had not [yet] arrived (see Tractate Megillah 5a). And we stated regardingמתנות לאביונים /gifts for the poor, he wants to say that if he gave מתנות לאביונים on those days, that is to say, on the eleventh, twelfth [or] thirteenth [of Adar], he has fulfilled his religious obligation. But Rabbi Yehuda explains the words of the Sages (see Tractate Sanhedrin 25a) that were mentioned above."

31,11,Talmud,Chagigah 4a:5,"The Gemara answers: This statement was necessary, as otherwise it could enter your mind to say: Let us derive by means of a verbal analogy between the term: Appearance, which appears here, and the term: Appearance, stated with regard to the mitzva of assembly (Deuteronomy 31:11), which is also a positive, time-bound mitzva. Just as there, women are obligated in the mitzva of assembly, so too here, women are obligated in the mitzva of appearance on the Festival. Therefore, the baraita teaches us that women are exempt."
31,11,Talmud,Chagigah 3a:2,"The Gemara explains: With regard to their exemption from the obligation of appearance, the tanna derives this halakha by means of a verbal analogy between the term appearance stated with regard to the mitzva of appearance at the Temple on the pilgrim Festival and the term appearance stated with regard to the mitzva of assembly, i.e., the obligation to assemble in the Temple on Sukkot in the year following the Sabbatical Year. As it is written, with regard to the mitzva of assembly: “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” (Deuteronomy 31:12), and it is written in that context: “When all of Israel come to appear” (Deuteronomy 31:11). Just as a deaf person and a mute are not obligated to attend the assembly, they are likewise exempt from appearing in the Temple on the Festivals."
31,11,Talmud,Chagigah 3a:8,"Rabbi Tanḥum said: One who is deaf in one ear is exempt from the mitzva of appearance in the Temple, as it is stated with regard to the mitzva of assembly: “When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their ears” (Deuteronomy 31:11). This verse indicates that the obligation of assembly applies only to those who can hear with both ears. Since the two mitzvot are connected by verbal analogy, as explained above, this halakha applies to the mitzva of appearance as well."
31,11,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Chagigah 1:1:2,"חוץ מחרש – and even though he can speak, and even one who is deaf in one ear is exempt, as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:11): “When all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God [in the place that He will choose…],” and it written after this (verse 12): “[Gather the people….]-that they may hear….,” excluding one who lacks complete hearing. And the person who hears but cannot speak is also exempt as it is written (verse 12): “...[that they may hear] and learn [to revere the LORD your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching].” (NOTE: Rabbinic tradition, as found in the Mishnah of Tractate Terumot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 2, teaches that the deaf-mute individual, of whom the Sages generally spoke in all places, both cannot hear and cannot speak, and the Bartenura commentary on this Mishnah.

Therefore, the Torah specifically exempts women from the pilgrimage."
31,11,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Chagigah 1:1:4,"וטומטום ואנדרוגינוס, נשים ועבדים שאינן משוחררין – all of these are excluded from [the word] זכורך/”your males,” (Deuteronomy 16:16) except for one whose sex is unknown, a hermaphrodite and a woman who are not included within [the term] זכורך/”your males.” For any commandment for which women are not obligated [to perform], slaves are also not obligated [to perform]. And further, when it [the Torah] states (Deuteronomy 31:11): “When all Israel comes to appear [before the LORD your God]...” and slaves are not considered part of the Jewish people. (See also Mishnah Bikkurim, Chapter 1, Mishnah 5, regarding the one whose sex is unknown and the hermaphrodite in regard to their exemption from the bringing of First Fruits to the Temple.)"
31,11,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Chagigah 1:1:6,"והסומא – as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:11): “When all Israel comes to appear…” Just as they come to be seen, so they come to see the Holy Mountain and the House of God’s Divine Presence, which excludes someone who is blind, even in his one eye, for his sight is not complete."
31,12,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Pesach, Festival Prayers 12","People are accustomed to reading the Song of Songs on the Festival of Matzot because it speaks about the salvation from Egypt, which is the beginning of the subjugation of Israel and their first redemption. As it is stated (Song of Songs 1:9), ""To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots."" And they are also accustomed to read Ruth on the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), because it is written in it (Ruth 1:22), ""at the beginning of the barley harvest"" - and [Shavuot] is the the time of the harvest. And there is another reason: Because our ancestors only accepted the Torah and entered the covenant through circumcision, immersion and the sprinkling of blood [at that time], as it is found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz; and Ruth also converted, as it is stated (Ruth 1:16), ""for where you go, I shall go."" And from the answer of Ruth, we know what Noami said to her. As she said to her, ""It is prohibited for us [to go beyond] the Shabbat perimeter."" [She answered,] ""Where you go, I shall go"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Isolation [with a stranger of the opposite sex] is forbidden to us."" ""Where you lodge, I shall lodge"" (Ruth 1:16). ""We are commanded to observe six hundred and thirteen commandments."" ""Your people are my people"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us."" ""Your God is my God"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Four types of capital punishment were handed over to the court."" ""Where you die, I shall die"" (Ruth 1:17). ""Two burial grounds were set up for the court, one for those burnt and stoned and another for those executed and strangled."" ""And there I shall be buried"" (Ruth 1:17). So is it found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz (Yevamot 47b). And we are hence accustomed to reading Ruth on  the Holiday of Weeks. And also on the Festival of Shemini Atzeret (Assembly of the Eighth), it is customary to read Ecclesiastes, because in it, it is written (Ecclesiastes 11:1), ""Distribute portions to seven or even to eight"" - these [correspond to] the seven days of the Festival (Sukkot) and the Festival of the Assembly of the Eighth. I mean to say, because it is the holiday of the reaping, to warn about the tithes and the priestly tithes and the pledges, such that they not transgress, ""you shall not delay,"" [past] the three festivals. And there is another reason - because King Shlomo said it on the Festival (Sukkot) during the assembly (hakhel). As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:10-12), ""at the appointed time of the year of remission, during the Sukkot festival;  When all of Israel comes to be seen, etc. Assemble (Hakhel) the people; the men and the women and the infants, etc."" And it is [also] written (I Kings 8:2), ""they assembled before King Shlomo in the month of Etanim during the festival, etc."" So he said it then in the assembly, to rebuke Israel. Hence it is fit to say it during [this] festival. All of this was written by Ibn HaYarchi (R. Avraham ben Natan). And they said in Tractate Soferim (14:3), ""One who reads from Ruth, the Song of Songs, Lamentations and from the Scroll of Esther must [recite the blessing that concludes], 'concerning the reading of the Megillah' - even though it is included in the Writings. One who reads from the Writings must recite, 'Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, [who has sanctified us with Your commandments and has commanded us] to read in the Holy Writings.'""

"
31,12,Commentary,Kli Yakar on Deuteronomy 31:12:2,"And it appears that the whole essence of this hakhel (assembly) is on account of repentance. As our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Vayikra Rabba 30:7) that the first day of the Holiday (Sukkot) is called the first [day] of the calculation of iniquities. Therefore they must immediate make preparation towards repentance; and that preparation is is this assembly, in which the king assembles the people and reads from Deuteronomy. For most of the book is words of chastisement for sins and words of submission. And it is already known that the assembly is very necessary for repentance. As by their being assembled, they would be one group and they would turn together to do repent to God in order that the penitents be [considered] a public. As it is specifically during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur that the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts the repentance of an individual. However during all [the rest] of the days of the year, the Holy One, blessed be He, only accepts the repentance of the community (Rosh Hashanah 18a). And this is the meaning of that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, [in Vayikra Rabba], ""'And you shall take for yourselves on the first day' (Leviticus 23:40) - and is it the first; is it not the fifteenth [of the month]? Rather it is the first [day] in the calculation of iniquities, etc."" But whey did Scripture mention  this matter specifically in the verse that is speaking about the four species; and why did it not mention this in the verse that is speaking about sitting in the sukkah? Rather it is because in the taking of the four species, it hints to all of the four clusters of Jews becoming one group, as explained above in Parashat Emor (Kli Yakar on Leviticus 23:40). And the verse needs to give a good explanation and understanding for why it is specifically on this day that they were commanded to do this commandment that instructs that all of Israel be one group to atone for one another. Rather it is because from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, the Holy One, blessed be He accepts even the repentance of the individual. Hence they do not yet need to be one group, so that the penitents be [considered] a public. And from Yom Kippur to the holiday of Sukkot, they do not do iniquities, since everyone is occupied with the commandments of the sukkah and the lulav. And 'a commandment drags along [another] commandment.' Hence, generally 'no harm befalls the righteous' until the first day of Sukkot, which is the first [day] of the calculation of iniquities. Hence they need to make a preparation for repentance; and that preparation is that they should all be one, like these four species. And that is why it is stated, ""And you shall take for yourselves on the first day"" -- to give an enriching reason, why I commanded you about the taking of these four species in a group specifically on this day: Because it is the first day of of the calculation of iniquities. Hence you need to make a preparation towards repentance for all of the days of the year. And this preparation is when you become one group, like these four species. Then God will accept your repentance, since 'Behold, God does not despise the mighty' (see Berachot 8a)."
31,12,Commentary,Kli Yakar on Deuteronomy 31:12:3,"And this is also a reason for this hakhel (assembly). As in addition to the taking of these four species on the first day of the festival, God commanded to make another impression similar to [the impression made by] it, at the end of seven years. Since the seventh year also causes assembly and peace by way of one not planting and growing upon it. And the destitute of His people eat on it, since the [landowners] are not permitted to hold on to their produce on the seventh year as [would usually be the way of] an owner. And without a doubt, this is is a cause of peace, since all disagreements are from the trait of ""what's mine is mine"" [and] ""this one says, 'it is all mine.'"" And this is not so [prevalent] on the seventh year, since [even if] in the positive acts, not all are equal, in the negative acts, all are equal, and this is truly the way of peace. And so [too] with the festival of Sukkot, when everyone goes out from a permanent dwelling to a temporary dwelling and sits under the 'Sukkah (hut) of His peace.' Behold, [accordingly] on the first of the intermediate days, the king was commanded to make an impression about peace and this is the matter of hakhel. As all of this is a preparation to repentance, and [so] he reads from Deuteronomy words of exhortation and rebuke. And this is [the meaning of] what they said, ""'the men' to learn, etc, 'the youngsters' - why are they coming, to bring reward to those that bring them."" Since in the time when Israel repents, they offer supplications in front of Him, may He be blessed, for the forgiving of sin and say, ""If not for our sake, then do it for the sake of those weaned from their mothers, who have not sinned."" [This is] as it is found in the text of 'Avinu Malkenu' - Have mercy on our sucklings and on our youngsters. And we [also] say, ""Do it for those weaned from their mothers, etc."" And this is the reward that is given to those that bring them, from the youngsters - that they will say in front of Him, may He be blessed, ""Do it for the sake of these youngsters that are brought to the House of God,"" in the same way as it stated in Joel 2:16, ""Collect the people, sanctify the assembly, gather the elders, collect the sucklings, and those that suck the breasts, etc."

31,12,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 19:4,"Another interpretation: “This is the statute of the paschal offering [no foreigner shall eat of it]” – that is what is written: “The foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord shall not speak, saying: The Lord has separated me from His people” (Isaiah 56:3). (The verse quoted prohibits foreigners from partaking of the paschal offering. However, a later verse presents the possibility of that foreigner joining himself to Israel and then partaking of the offering: “When a stranger will reside with you, and will perform the paschal offering to the Lord, circumcise all his males, and then he may draw near and perform it; and he will be like a native of the land; and all uncircumcised shall not eat of it. There shall be one law for the native, and for the stranger who resides with you (Exodus 12:48–9).)  Job said: “The stranger shall not spend the night outside” (Job 31:32). The Holy One blessed be He does not reject any creature, but rather, He accepts everyone. The gates open at all times, and anyone who seeks to enter may enter. That is why it says: “The stranger shall not spend the night outside,” corresponding to: “The stranger who is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 31:12). “I opened My doors to the road” (Job 31:32), [is said] of the Holy One blessed be He, that He tolerates His creations.  Rabbi Berekhya said: Corresponding to whom did He say: “The stranger [hager] shall not spend the night outside” (Job 31:32)? Rather, converts [gerim] (The Biblical word for stranger, ger, also means convert in Rabbinic Hebrew. )  are destined to be priests serving in the Temple, as it is stated: “The stranger [hager] will join himself with them, and they will be appended to the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 14:1). Appended [venispeḥu] means nothing other than priesthood, as it is stated: “Append me [sefaḥeni], please, to one of the priestly watches” (I Samuel 2:36). They are destined to partake of the showbread, for their daughters will marry into the priesthood.  And so did Akilas the proselyte ask our Rabbis. He said to them: ‘That which is written: “He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing” (Deuteronomy 10:18) – are all the promises that He promised to the stranger that He would give him food and clothing?’ One [of the Rabbis] said to him: ‘That is what Jacob, whose name is Israel, requested from the Holy One blessed be He: “…and will give me food to eat, and clothing to wear” (Genesis 28:20). You, who have come among us, it is not enough for you that you are like us, but it should be sufficient for you to be like Jacob, the firstborn of the Holy One blessed be He.’ Ultimately, you should not suppose that Jacob requested food and clothing. Rather, Jacob said: The Holy One blessed be He promised me that He will be with me, and that He will establish the world from me. When will I know that He is with me and that he is protecting me? When He establishes from me sons who are priests partaking of the showbread and wearing priestly vestments, as it is stated: “And will give me food to eat,” that is the showbread; and clothing to wear, those are the priestly vestments, as it is stated: “You shall clothe Aaron in the holy vestments” (Exodus 40:13). Here, too, “He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing” – in other words, He provides children to the stranger who will eat showbread and wear priestly vestments. That is, “the stranger shall not spend the night outside.”  The Holy One blessed be He said: After all the honor that I am destined to accord to the penitents, you are complaining? That is: “The foreigner, who has joined himself to the Lord, shall not speak…” (Isaiah 56:3). Alternatively, “the foreigner…shall not speak” – that is what is written: “Sing and rejoice daughter of Zion” (Zechariah 2:14), and it is written: “Many nations will join themselves to the Lord” (Zechariah 2:15). The Holy One blessed be He said: If I say so about converts, all the more so about Zion and Israel. “The foreigner…shall not speak.” The Holy One blessed be He said to the converts: You are concerned because I disqualified you and said regarding the paschal offering: “No foreigner shall eat of it?” Why don’t you ask the Givonites how I acted favorably to them? They are people who behaved deceitfully; acting out of fear [they] approached My children and took an oath to them. [Nevertheless,] what did I do to Saul and his household because he sought to kill them [the Givonites]? (See II Samuel 21:1 and Yevamot 78b. )  They [the Givonites] killed seven of his descendants, as it is stated: “The king took the two sons of Ritzpa…and the five sons of Mikhal” (II Samuel 21:8). (These descendants of Saul were handed over to the Givonites to be executed.)  The Holy One blessed be He said: If regarding the Givonites, who were Emorites, who acting out of fear behaved deceitfully with Israel, I accepted them, acted favorably to them, and I gave them satisfaction from My children; the converts who come in love, and serve for the sake of My name, won’t I accept them and exalt them?  Therefore, “the foreigner, who has joined himself to the Lord shall not say” (Isaiah 56:3) – these are the circumcised converts. The idolaters, however, have uncircumcised hearts, for thus the Holy One blessed be He disqualifies those with uncircumcised hearts and takes them down to Gehenna, as it is stated: “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and take them down” (Ezekiel 32:18). Likewise, Isaiah says: “Therefore, the grave expanded itself, and opened its mouth without measure [ḥok]” (Isaiah 5:14) – for an idolater who scorns the statute [ḥok] of circumcision, as it is stated: “He established it for Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant” (Psalms 105:10). Israel, who are circumcised, do not go down to Gehenna.  Rabbi Berekhya said: In order that the heretics and the wicked of Israel will not say: ‘Since we are circumcised, we will not descend to Gehenna,’ what does the Holy One blessed be He do? He sends an angel who extends their foreskin [rendering them uncircumcised] and they descend to Gehenna, as it is stated: “He extended his hands…profaned his covenant.” (Psalms 55:21). When Gehenna sees that the foreskin is connected to them, it opens its mouth and consumes them in fire; that is: “And opened its mouth without measure [ḥok].”"

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 31:12), “Gather all the nation — the men, the women, and the children, etc.” And this is the commandment of gathering (hak’hel) that is mentioned in the Gemara; like the matter that they said in the first [chapter] of Kiddushin 34a, “But behold, gathering which is a positive commandment that is caused by time, and women are obligated!” And they explained at the end of the topic, “We do not learn from general rules,” which means to say that truthfully women are obligated in this commandment."

31,12,Jewish Thought,"Guide for the Perplexed, Part 3 46:12","The reason of the particular laws concerning the Passover lamb is clear. It was eaten roasted by fire (Exod. 12:8-9) in one house, and without breaking the bones thereof (ibid. ver. 46). In the same way as the Israelites were commanded to eat unleavened bread, because they could prepare it hastily, so they were commanded, for the sake of haste, to roast the lamb, because there was not sufficient time to boil it, or to prepare other food; even the delay caused by breaking the bones and to extract their marrow was prohibited the one principle is laid down for all these rules, “Ye shall eat it in haste” (Exod. 12:11). But when haste is necessary the bones cannot be broken, nor parts of it sent from house to house; for the company could not wait with their meal till he returned. Such things would lead to laxity and delay, whilst the object of these rules was to make a show of the hurry and haste, in order that none should be too late to leave Egypt with the main body of the people, and be thus exposed to the attacks and the evil [designs of the enemy]. These temporary commandments were then made permanent, in order that we may remember what was done in those days. “And thou shalt keep this ordinance in his season from year to year” (Exod. 13:10). Each Passover lamb was only eaten by those who had previously agreed to consume it together, in order that people should be anxious to procure it, and should not rely on friends, relations, or on chance, without themselves taking any trouble about it before Passover. The reason of the prohibition that the uncircumcised should not eat of it (Exod. 12:48) is explained by our Sages as follows:—The Israelites neglected circumcision during their long stay in Egypt, in order to make themselves appear like the Egyptians. When God gave them the commandment of the Passover, and ordered that no one should kill the Passover lamb unless he, his sons, and all the male persons in his household were circumcised, that only “then he could come near and keep it” (ibid. 12:48), all performed this commandment, and the number of the circumcised being large the blood of the Passover and that of the circumcision flowed together. The Prophet Ezekiel (xvi. 6), referring to this event, says, “When I saw thee sprinkled with thine own blood I said unto thee, Live because of thy [two kinds of ] blood, “i.e., because of the blood of the Passover and that of the circumcision. Now there remained to provide for the slaughtering of the beasts of the field and birds, because those beasts were never sacrificed, and birds did never serve as peace-offerings (Lev. iii.). The commandment was therefore given that whenever a beast or a bird that may be eaten is killed, the blood thereof must be covered with earth (Lev. 17:13), in order that the people should not assemble round the blood for the purpose of eating there. The object was thus fully gained to break the connexion between these fools and their spirits."
31,12,Mishnah,Mishnah Megillah 1:3,"What is considered a large city, where the Megilla is read on the fourteenth of Adar? Any city in which there are ten idlers. However, if there are fewer than that, it is considered a village, even if it has many inhabitants. It was with regard to these times for reading the Megilla that the Sages said that one advances the reading of the Megilla before the fourteenth of Adar and one does not postpone the reading to after its proper time. However, with regard to the time when families of priests donate wood for the fire on the altar, which were times those families would treat as Festivals; as well as the fast of the Ninth of Av; the Festival peace-offering that was brought on the Festivals; and the commandment of assembly [hakhel] of the entire Jewish people in the Temple courtyard on Sukkot in the year following the Sabbatical year to hear the king read the book of Deuteronomy; one postpones their observance until after Shabbat and does not advance their observance to before Shabbat. The mishna continues: Even though the Sages said that one advances the time for reading the Megilla and one does not postpone the reading, one is permitted to eulogize and fast on these days, as they are not actually Purim; nevertheless, gifts for the poor are distributed on this day. Rabbi Yehuda said: When is the Megilla read on the day of assembly, before the fourteenth of Adar? In a place where the villagers generally enter town on Monday and Thursday. However, in a place where they do not generally enter town on Monday and Thursday, one may read the Megilla only in its designated time, the fourteenth of Adar."
31,12,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Khagigah 1:3","Our Rabbis were taught: It happened that R. Jochanan b. Broka and R. Elazar b. Chasma went to visit R.

""Nevertheless,"" said he, ""it is impossible that there should not be something new in the college; whose Sabbath was it for lecturing?"" ""The lecture of this Sabbath was R. Elazar b. Azariah's.""

31,12,Halakhah,"Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 16:1","That is that He commanded us to assemble the people on the second day of Sukkot at the end of the sabbatical year, and to read some sections of Deuteronomy so they can hear it. And that is His saying, ""Assemble the people, the men, etc."" - and that is the commandment of assembly. And they said in Kiddushin (Kiddushin 33b-34a), ""Women are exempt from all positive, time-bound commandments."" And they asked, ""But behold, assembly is a positive, time-bound commandment, and women are obligated!"" However they explained at the end of the matter, ""We do not learn [all cases] from general statements (i.e. 'all positive time-bound commandments').""

31,12,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 2:1","Women and servants are exempt from the obligation to appear before God on festivals. All men are obligated to appear with the exception of a deaf person, a mute, one who is emotionally or intellectually incapable of controlling himself, a minor, a blind person, one who is limp, one who is impure, one who is uncircumcised, and similarly, one who is old, sick, very dainty and spoiled to the extent they cannot ascend by foot. All of these eleven persons are exempt. All other men are obligated to appear before God. To explain these categories in greater detail: A deaf person is exempt even if he can speak. Even if he is deaf in only one ear, he is exempt from appearing. Similarly, one who is blind in one eye or limp in one leg, is exempt. A mute even though he hears is exempt. A tumtum and an androgynus are exempt, because there is a doubt whether they are female. A person who is half-servant and half-free is exempt, because of the side of him that is a servant. What is the source that all the above are exempt from appearing before God? Exodus 23:17 states: ""All of your males shall appear""; this excludes women. And any positive commandment for which women are not obligated, servants are not obligated. Moreover, Deuteronomy 31:11 ""When all Israel come to appear""; this excludes servants. The phrase ""When all Israel come to appear"" implies that just as they come to appear before God, so too, they come to see the glory of His holiness and the house where His presence rests. Thus it excludes a blind person who cannot see; he is exempt even if only one eye is blinded, because his sight is not perfect. That passage continues: ""So that they will hear."" This excludes one whose hearing is not perfect. And it states: ""So that they will learn."" This excludes one who does not speak, because everyone who is obligated to learn is also obligated to teach. Exodus 34:24 states: ""When you ascend to appear before the presence of God."" The command is directed to one who can ascend by foot and thus excludes one who is limp, old, sick, or very dainty. And we have already explained in Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash that a person who is impure is not fit to enter the Temple. And one is uncircumcised is loathsome like one who is impure."
31,12,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 3:1","It is a positive commandment to gather together the entire Jewish people - men, women, and children - after every Sabbatical year when they ascend for the pilgrimage holiday and to read so that they hear passages from the Torah that encourage them to perfom mitzvot and strengthem them in the true faith, as Deuteronomy 31:10-12 states: ""At the end of a seven-year period, at the time of the Sabbatial year on the Sukkot holiday when all Israel come to appear... gather the nation, the men, the women, the children, and your stranger in your gates...."""

His only recourse (Esther 4:11) and the territory of his inheritance (Deut. 32:9) is to strip himself, and to cut and offer [himself] as a complete sin offering. He will be morally strong to bind with a bond forbidding (Num. 30:3) that which he has not heard from his teachers. He makes even all his paths (Prov. 5:21) and the utterances of his lips (Ps. 21:3). For if he falls (Deut. 22:8), who will raise him up? (Gen. 49:9).

Therefore, as it is explicitly stated that women are obligated in assembly, the verses concerning matza and assembly are two verses that come as one, and consequently do not teach a precedent."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Leviticus 25:9:1,"THEN SHALT THOU MAKE PROCLAMATION WITH THE BLAST OF THE HORN. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the world was created in Nisan or in Tishri. (See Rosh Ha-Shanah 10a, 11a.)  There is no need to dwell on this, for the transmitters of the law ordained that we are to say in the Rosh Ha-Shanah prayer which they established for us, “This day marks the beginning of Your works, it is a memorial of the first day.” (In other words, the accepted opinion among the sages is that the world was created on Rosh Ha-Shanah.)  We also read in Scripture that the shofar is to be sounded in the Jubilee year in the month of Tishri at the beginning of the year. (Verse 9.)  Furthermore, (This sentence and the following sentence are omitted in some editions of I.E. The Mikra’ot Gedolot places it in parentheses.)  the Torah, in the portion commanding the people to gather to hear the Torah read states that the Torah is to be read on the festival of Sukkot. (At the start of the Sabbatical year. This is the way I.E. interprets Deut 31:10. See Vol. 4, p. 225. See Deut. 31:10-13.)  Scripture writes, that they may hear, and that they may learn (Deut. 31:12). (According to I.E. that they may hear, and that they may learn means that they may hear, and that they may learn the entire year. See I.E. on Deut. 31:12 (Vol. 5, p. 225).)  It is not possible for this (The reading and the study of the Torah.)  to take place after half a year has passed. (If Nisan is the beginning of the year then the public reading of the Torah which initiates a mass study of the Torah takes place six months after the start of the New Year. According to I.E. this makes no sense, for the study of the Torah in the Sabbatical year is similar to the study of the Torah on the Sabbath (I.E. on Deut. 31:12). Now the study of the Torah on the Sabbath starts with the onset of the Sabbath. It does not start at midday. Similarly, the study of the Torah in the Sabbatical year. Furthermore, why waste half of a year that could be devoted to Torah study.)  Furthermore, (This and the following sentence are omitted in the Margali’ot Tuva edition of I.E. The Mikra’ot Gedolot places it in brackets.)  Scripture states, and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year (Ex. 23:16). Similarly, and the feast of the ingathering at the turn of the year (Ex. 34:22). (We thus see that the Festival of Sukkot comes at the turn of the year, not six months earlier. According to I.E. and other commentaries, the year in these two verses is agricultural, so “turn of the year” and “end of the year” have a similar meaning. See Vol. 3, pp. 503,723.)  The faithful proof is the Sabbatical year, regarding which it is written, ye shall not sow (v. 11). They start sowing in the month of Marcheshvan in the Land of Israel. If the beginning of the year started in Nisan, then they would not harvest that which they sowed in the sixth year (In the fall preceding the Sabbatical year, for harvesting is prohibited in the Sabbatical year.)  and they would not sow, (In the seventh year.)  for it is the Sabbatical year. Since they will not harvest (In the seventh year.)  what they planted in the sixth year, they will not sow twice. (In the sixth and in the seventh year. There is no point to sowing in the sixth year if what is planted cannot be harvested. Hence they will not sow in the sixth year. They will thus not sow in the sixth and seventh years.)  However, Scripture states that they should not sow in the seventh year alone. (In other words, Scripture speaks only of not sowing in the seventh year.)  Judah Ha-Parsi (An early Karaite. See I.E. on Ex. 12:2 and the notes thereto (Vol. 2, p. 203).)  said that Israel employed a solar calendar. (I.E. earlier dealt with the start of the year He now goes on to explain how the year is calculated.)  Now if this were so [then we do not know the exact time that a year begins] for, note, Moses did not explain the length of a complete year and so far the astronomers are unable to bring the length of a solar year to light. For example, the wise men of India add a fifth of an hour to the quarter of the day. (A solar year consists of about 365 and 1/4 days. The wise men of India add a fifth of an hour to the aforementioned. They claim that a solar year consists of 365 and 1/4 days plus a fifth of an hour.)  Ptolemy and his friends say that 1/300 of the day is missing. (According to Ptolemy a solar year consists of 365 and 1/4 days minus 1/300 of the day.)  This is close to that of the intercalated calendar. Those who came after him said one part of 106. (Parts are to be subtracted from the quarter of the day.)  Others said 110. (Parts are to be subtracted from the quarter of the day.)  Still others said 130. (Parts of the day are to be subtracted from the quarter of the day.)  There are those who say 180. (Parts of the day are to be subtracted from the quarter of the day.)  For there are those who calculate the year when the sun concludes a cycle around the constellations from a visible point. (In other words, when the sun concludes a cycle around the constellations from any given point. This is the opinion of those who believe that the year consists of 365 days plus 1/4 of a day and a fifth of an hour (Krinsky).)  Others calculate it from a point on the sphere which inclines to the right and the left. (Others calculate it from a point on the inclined sphere. That is the sphere of the constellations. This is the opinion of those who believe that a year consists of 365 days plus a little less than 1/4 of the day (Krinsky).)  We need tradition. (To determine what Scripture means by a year.)  Furthermore, the meaning of the word chodesh (month) contradicts the Persian. (The word chodesh literally means new moon. I.E. will soon show that a solar calendar has no true months, for the new moons play no role in establishing a solar year.)  The Sadducees (The Karaites.)  say that the Jewish religion is based on a lunar year. Note, there is no year at all to the moon. (If we follow a lunar calendar then strictly speaking there is no year, for a year is determined by the cycle of the sun.)  However, as the sun has no months, the calculators (Of the calendar.)  sought (For practical reasons.)  a number of months close to that of a solar year. (Those who employed a solar calendar wanted to divide the year into months.)  They found them to be 12. (Twelve cycles of the moon come close to one cycle of the sun.)  The calculators (Of the calendar.)  sought a number of days for the month (Of a solar year.)  that would be close to the number of days into which a lunar month is divided. Our months are therefore lunar months and our years return (Begin once again.)  at the end of a solar year. (The Jewish calendar is both solar and lunar.)  Our sages therefore transmitted to us a law given to Moses from Sinai that the Bet Din always made seven leap years in every cycle (Of 19 solar years. The following is the order of leap years: 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19. The numbers indicate the location of the leap year in the cycle. At the end of 19 years the solar and “lunar” years equalize.)  even though they used to establish every month by sighting the moon. (In other words, even though they employed a lunar calendar with regard to the months, they harmonized the lunar with the solar calendar.)  The secret of the cycle (The 19-year cycle.)  is known from the science of the stars. (It was first discovered in the fifth century by the Greek astronomer Meton.)  "
31,12,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Third Treatise on Service of God 3:18","It sometimes also happens that an individual falls short in some duties and exceeds in others. The intellectual stimulus varies in different individuals in accordance with their capacity of recognition. But the urge of the Torah is not subject to variation. Its form is the same for the child, the youth, one advanced in years and the old man, the wise and the foolish, even though the resulting practice varies in different classes of individuals. And so Scripture says in regard to the all encompassing character of the instruction of the Torah for all the people, ""Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and the stranger that is within your gate, (that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the L-ord your G-d . . .)""

31,12,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Leviticus 19:2:1","During an assembly. You might ask: Moshe taught the whole Torah to Israel as Rashi says in parshas Ki Sisa.

Another answer is: Moshe [generally] taught them in groups, one after the other, but this parshah was in the assembly of all Israel. The difference [of teaching in this manner] was that no one could say, “I do not accept this mitzvah because I have questions against it, and the reason I did not ask Moshe immediately is because not all Israel were present there.” Therefore, [here] all Israel were together so that no one could say this.

And In order for them to learn refers to the men. The children are not included in either hearing or learning, but [rather come] to bring merit to those who brought them.
"
31,12,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 35:1:8,"There is a Yalkut Shimoni, 408 which understands the reason why the Torah chose the word ויקהל as an allusion to the same word in Deut. 31,12. The message is that on the Sabbath there are to be large assemblies of the people in order to teach them Torah and especially אלה הדברים, the details about the ordinances connected with true Sabbath observance. The words לעשות אותם also had special significance for the generation of the golden calf as it holds out the hope that by ""doing them"" the people could make atonement for their participation in that sin, as per the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael in that Midrash."
31,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:12:2,"Perhaps the answer is contained in the very instructions to Moses having been to ""assemble the people, the men, the women and the children"" in order to read the Torah before them, something women are not obligated to hear. In Deut 11,19 the Torah's instructions to teach it had been reserved for בניכם, your male children, as opposed to your daughters (compare Kidushin 29). This may have been the reason the Torah separated the ""hearing"" from the ""learning"" in our verse and wrote the word למען twice. The males, including the male children, were to study the Torah; the women and their daughters were to listen to the Torah."
31,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:12:3,"The Torah first speaks about למען ישמעו, ""in order that they hearken"" as it refers to the negative commandments which apply equally to men and women. "
31,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:12:4,"The words למען ילמדו, ""in order that they learn,"" refer to the positive commandments many of which women are not obligated to perform if they must be performed only at certain times. Had the Torah lumped both statements together we would have concluded that negative and positive commandments both carry the same penalties."
31,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:12:5,"I have seen a statement by our sages in Chagigah 3 ""the women were to come to listen whereas the men were to attend in order to study."""
31,12,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Bo, Torah Ohr 31","Pharaoh said to Moses that he did not comprehend the meaning of the term עבודה, ""service."" He did not know if Moses referred only to the offering of a sacrifice, and if that was the meaning of עבודה, or if Moses referred to some other activity which represented the carrying out of a Heavenly command but not including sacrifices. If the meaning of עבודה was the performance of other activties it made sense that both adults and children would be required. This would be similar to the Torah requiring the presence of adults and children in Deut. 31,12 for the public reading of the Torah once in seven years during the מצות הקהל, the general assembly at the end of Tabernacles. On such an occasion however, there would be no need for the presence of their livestock. If, on the other hand, the meaning of עבודה was the sacrificial service of slaughtering animals, surely only the presence of men of all age groups was mandatory. What need was there for the presence of women and small children, i.e. טף? This is why Pharaoh repeated the word מי; he referred to the two alternatives."
31,12,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Sefer Vayikra, Torah Ohr, Kedoshim 2","Rabbi Chiyah taught in Vayikra Rabbah 24,5 that this portion was read out during the הקהל ceremony because so many basic elements of the Torah are contained therein. Yalkut Shimoni at the beginning of פרשת ויקהל states that the teachers of aggadic material concurred that there is no other portion of the Torah which starts with a report of the Jewish people all being assembled. G–d asked Moses to arrange for many mass meetings at which the laws of Sabbath observance would be taught. Subsequent generations were meant to learn from Moses how to teach Torah in public gatherings with the objective to glorify the name of G–d among the people. This is why Rabbi Chiyah was convinced that the portion of קדושים was read on the occasion of הקהל [a public gathering of the entire nation including women and children as per Deut. 31,12 at which the people were to hear and learn to fear the Lord. Ed.] Rabbi Chiyah further supports this by the opening verse in our פרשה."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,English Explanation of Mishnah Sotah 7:8:1,"Introduction
Deuteronomy 31:10-12 states, “Every seventh year, at the time of the sabbatical year, at Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Teaching aloud in the presence of all Israel.  Gather the people men, women, children and the strangers in your communities that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching.”
Our mishnah discusses how this ceremony, which is called by the rabbis “Gathering”, was performed.  The ceremony was performed on the holiday of Sukkot which immediately followed the end of the sabbatical year."
31,12,Tosefta,Tosefta Sotah 7:6,"It so happened with Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma, that they were traveling from Yavneh to Lod, [and they stopped] to pay a visit to Rabbi Yehoshua in Peki'in (בפקיעין not מפקיעין). Rabbi Yehoshua said to them, ""What news do you have from the house of study today?"" They said to him, ""Rabbi, we are your students, and from your waters we drink."" He said to them, ""It is impossible that there nothing new was discussed in the house of study. Whose week was it (see Ber. 28a:13)?"" They said to him, ""Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah."" He said to them, ""What did he discuss?"" They said to him, ""[He discussed the commandment of Hakhel, to] 'Gather the people, the men, the women, and the little children'""(Deut. 31:10-12).  He said to them, ""What did he expound about it?"" They said to him, ""He expounded thus: If men came to learn [and] women came to listen, why did the little children come? In order to bestow a reward upon those who brought them. And another thing that he expounded (Dev. 26:17-18), 'You have declared today for Hashem [to be your God] ... [and] God has declared today for you [to be his treasured people].' The Holy One Blessed be He said to Israel, just as you have made me your only object of love in this world, so too I will make you my only object of love in the World to Come."""
31,12,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 20:3:2,"This corresponds to (Numbers 20:8), “Speak to the boulder in their presence”—your prayer should be at a time when the congregation is assembled . And this is (Deuteronomy 31:12), “Gather together the people.”"
31,12,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Women's Prayer 7:1:2","The Torah belongs to all of Israel, men and women alike. When we recite “Who has chosen us from among all the nations” in Birkat Ha-Torah, we mean that God chose all of Israel, men and women, and consequently “gave us His Torah.” There is an accepted tradition: If even one Jewish maidservant would have been absent at the time of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, the giving would have been delayed. Likewise, the mitzva of hak’hel (the assembly at the Temple at the end of the Shemita year, at which the king would read part of the Torah to all Israel) applies to men, women, and children (Devarim 31:12)."
31,13,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:2","It is a positive mitzva to assemble all of Israel – men, women, and children – on Sukkot at the end of each Shemita year, during their pilgrimage to the Temple. Sections of the Torah that encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance are then read to them, as it is written: And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year, at the time of the Shemita year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Torah aloud in the presence of all Israel. Assemble (Hak’hel) the people – men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities – that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Torah. Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere the Lord your God as long as they live, in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess. (Devarim 31:10-13)"
31,13,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:4","Every participant benefited greatly from Hak’hel. Those able to study Torah in depth were inspired to increase their study. Those able to listen and understand were inspired to listen avidly to the Torah’s words and to live by them. Children who were old enough to understand listened to the words, and the sanctity of the occasion inspired and encouraged them to study Torah and keep mitzvot. As for those children who were too young to understand, their souls absorbed the tremendous value and incomparable importance of Torah, when they saw that everyone was gathering together to hear it. Their parents were inspired too, recognizing the monumental mission incumbent upon them: to educate their children to Torah and mitzvot (Ramban on Devarim 31:12-13; Maharal, Gur Aryeh, ad loc.; see Harḥavot)."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,"Rereading the Rabbis; A Woman's Voice, 10 Ritual 36","The Tosefta lists other positive time-bound mitzvot that obligate women that are not found in the Mishnah: They are required to eat matzah (unleavened bread), the paschal lamb, and bitter herbs (Tosefta Pesahim 2:22); they are required to bring the simhah sacrifice to the Temple on the three pilgrimage festivals, a remarkable requirement in view of the fact that the Torah requires only men to be seen three times a year at the Temple (Tosefta Hagigah 1:4). In fact, the rabbis themselves construct the entire notion of the requirement of a simhah sacrifice and also women’s obligation to bring it. (All the Torah requires is that a man not come empty-handed to the Temple on the pilgrimage festivals. It is the rabbis who determine that he must bring three kinds of sacrifices: olot re’iyah, shalmei hagigah, and shalmei simhah.)  It is possible they have the future in mind, or the past—the fact that women in the time of the Temple did bring festival sacrifices (See the article by Chana Safrai, “Women and Processes of Change in the Temple in Jerusalem,” in A View into the Lives of Women in Jewish Societies, ed. Yael Azmon (Jerusalem: Mercaz Shazar, 1995), 63–76.) —but more likely the simhah obligation is a statement on their part that women should be ritually involved, although not to the same extent as men. That is, they create for women an imaginary obligation of the past, not grounded in any verse, in order to suggest that women are obligated to be involved in religious ritual, even though certain exemptions still apply. They are not free to choose to become involved. Note also that the Torah itself requires women to be present at the reading of the entire Torah to the people, once in seven years on the holiday of Succot (Deuteronomy 31:12)."
31,12,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:12:3,"[THAT THEY MAY HEAR, AND THAT THEY MAY LEARN.] When they hear (The Torah being read.)  they will ask. And he who is not wise and the children who are young will learn."
31,12,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:1:3,"(The same text is in Soṭah3:4 (Notes 107–109, ס); Avot dR. Nathan A Chap. 18.)  As it was stated: It happened that Rebbi Joḥanan ben Beroqa and Rebbi Eleazar Ḥasma were walking from Jabneh to Lydda when they were visiting Rebbi Joshua in Beqi`in (An unidentified place. It cannot be the place of the same name in Galilee.) . He asked them, what was new today in the House of Study? They said to him, we all are your students and drink from your waters. He said to them, even so, it is impossible that there not be a new idea every day in the House of Study. Who stayed there over the Sabbath? They said to him, Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah. And what was his text? Assemble the people, men, women, and toddlers. He started by saying, since men come to learn and women to listen, why do the toddlers come? It must be to give a reward to those who bring them. He said to them, a generation is not orphaned which counts Rebbi Eleazar ben Azariah among them."
31,12,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 1:1:8,"“The child.” Rebbi Jeremiah and Rebbi Ayvo bar Naggari were sitting. They said, we have stated: Who is a child? Any who cannot ride on his father’s shoulder.” And can a child hear and can a child speak (While a child can hear and speak, it usually will not understand (meant here by “hear”) and it cannot teach (understood by “speak”).) ? They turned around and said, all your males (Ex. 23:17, Deut. 16:16, description of who is required to appear in the Temple on a festival of pilgrimage. Babli 4a; Mekhilta dR. Ismael Mišpatim Chap. 20 (ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 333).) , to include the child. Or should we say, to include the deaf-mute? So they should hear and learn (To fulfill the biblical commandment to “be seen” before God on the occasion of the three festivals of pilgrimage which are called either steps (Ex. 23:17, Deut. 16:16) or walking occasions (Ex. 23:14, 34:23). The cases exempted from this biblical duty are defined in the Halakhah.) , to exclude (the child) [the deaf-mute. Or should we say, so they should hear and learn, to exclude the child?] (Corrector’s addition, unnecessary.)  Rebbi Yose said, since one verse excludes and one verse includes, I am including the child who will be able to come in the future, and excluding the deaf-mute who will not be able to come in the future. Samuel bar Abba asked before Rebbi Ze`ira: May a deaf-mute child be liable (According to the Babli, 6a, this question refers to a deaf-mute child whom the experts give a chance of recovering hearing and/or speech.) ? He said to him, come and see; the permanent dweller (in Heaven) [on earth] (The corrector’s change introduces the Babli’s idiom; it should be deleted. The expression means that one was seeking proof in extraneous sources when the answer is readily available intrinsically.)  and the traveller in the highest Heaven? Since an adult deaf-mute is not liable, a child deaf-mute not a fortiori? Rebbi Jeremiah said, it would have been logical that a child who is no deaf-mute should be not liable (In this discussion, it should be pointed out that the child is never liable, and cannot be liable before becoming an adult. The question is whether the parent is liable to bring the child to the Temple.) . It is the decision of the verse, all your males, to include the child. I would say, but a (child) [adult] (Corrector’s change, misunderstanding the text, to be deleted. The scribe’s text also implies that there should be no distinction made between the minor and the adult deaf-mute.)  deaf-mute should be liable, not to split the practice of males. Therefore what Rebbi Yose said is necessary: since one verse excludes and one verse includes, I am including the child who will be able to come in the future, and excluding the deaf-mute who will not be able to come in the future."

Rebbi Yose said, this implies that he may not send his appearance sacrifice by another person. Rebbi Shammai asked, or maybe the other way. Those afflicted by scabies or polyps (are exempt from appearance, since it is written when all of Israel comes. Rebbi Shammai turned around and said, Those afflicted by scabies or polyps) even though they cannot come with all of Israel, they can come by themselves (Since coming and bringing are mentioned in separate verses, they are separate obligations.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk on the path, and when you lie down, and when you rise up” (Deuteronomy 6:6–7); “ . . . that you may learn them, and observe to do them” (Deuteronomy 5:1); “ . . . that they may learn” (Deuteronomy 31:12). The book of Joshua states, “You shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein” (1:8). Shimon ha-Tzaddik, a member of the Great Assembly, reveals the value and importance of the Torah in his statement: “The world is based on three things – Torah, divine service, and the practice of kindliness.” (Mishnah, Avot 1:2.)  After the destruction of the Second Temple, when the Torah was construed as the only supreme value, the Sages determined that “The study of Torah outweighs them all.” (Mishnah, Pe’ah 1:1.) "

31,12,Talmud,Chagigah 3a:6,"Mar Zutra said that one should read into the verse: That they may teach [yelamdu], instead of: “That they may learn [yilmedu]” (Deuteronomy 31:12). Even if a mute person is able to learn he cannot teach others. Rav Ashi said that the verse is certainly to be read: That they may teach. As, if it enters your mind that one should read: “That they may learn,” as it is written, and you will explain that since he is not able to speak he is not able to learn, and similarly the reason for the exemption of a deaf person is that since he is not able to hear he is not able to learn, you will have erred. According to this interpretation, it is clear from the context that a deaf person is exempted by the phrase: “That they may hear,” not merely due to his lack of hearing but because his inability to hear prevents him from learning."
31,12,Talmud,Chagigah 3a:17,"They said to him that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya interpreted the following verse: “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” (Deuteronomy 31:12).

They come in order for God to give a reward to those who bring them, i.e., God credits those who bring their children to the assembly.

31,12,Talmud,Chagigah 3a:2,"The Gemara explains: With regard to their exemption from the obligation of appearance, the tanna derives this halakha by means of a verbal analogy between the term appearance stated with regard to the mitzva of appearance at the Temple on the pilgrim Festival and the term appearance stated with regard to the mitzva of assembly, i.e., the obligation to assemble in the Temple on Sukkot in the year following the Sabbatical Year. As it is written, with regard to the mitzva of assembly: “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” (Deuteronomy 31:12), and it is written in that context: “When all of Israel come to appear” (Deuteronomy 31:11).

It is taught: there was an incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma, who went to greet Rabbi Yehoshua in Pekiin. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: ‘What novel idea was taught today in the study hall?’ They said to him: ‘We are your students and we drink from your water.’ He said to them: ‘Nevertheless, it is impossible for there to be a study hall without a novel idea.’ He asked them: ‘Whose week was it?’ ‘It was the week of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.’ (See Berakhot 28a, where the arrangement that had Rabban Gamliel serving at the head of the yeshiva three weeks a month and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya one week is explained.)  ‘On what was the lecture today?’ They said to him: ‘It was regarding the portion of assembly.’ ‘What did he expound in its regard?’ ‘“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the children” (Deuteronomy 31:12). If men come to learn, and women come to hear, why the children? It is in order to reward those who bring them.’ He said to them: ‘You had this fine pearl in your hands, and you sought to conceal it from me?’  Moreover, he expounded: “You have elevated the Lord this day.… And the Lord has elevated you, this day…” (Deuteronomy 26:17–18) – the Holy One blessed be He said to the Jewish people: You have rendered Me a single entity in the world, as it is written: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4), and I will render you a single entity in the world, as it is stated: “Who is like Your people, like Israel, one nation on earth” (II Samuel 7:23).  He also commenced and taught: “The words of the wise are like goads” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – why are matters of Torah likened to a goad? It is to tell you: Just as this goad directs the cow to its furrows to bring life to the world, so, matters of Torah direct the heart of those who study them from the paths of death to the paths of life. If so, just as this goad is movable, so too matters of Torah are movable? The verse states: “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). If so, just as this nail diminishes and does not expand, (When the nail is removed from the wall, it leaves a hole.)  so, matters of Torah diminish and do not expand. The verse states: “Implanted [netuim]” – just as this sapling [netia] flourishes and multiplies, so too, matters of Torah flourish and multiply. “The collectors of wisdom [baalei asupot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – these are Torah scholars, who sit in many groups [asupot] and engage in Torah study. These rule it ritually impure and those rule it pure; these prohibit and those permit; these disqualify and those rule it valid. Lest a person say: Since these rule it ritually impure and those rule it pure; these prohibit and those permit; these disqualify and those rule it valid, how can I study Torah now? The verse states: “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). One God gave them; one leader said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, blessed be He, as it is written: “God spoke all these matters” (Exodus 20:1). You, too, render your ears like a funnel and acquire for yourself a heart that hears the statements of those who rule it ritually impure and the statements of those who rule it pure; the statements of those who prohibit and the statements of those who permit; the statements of those who disqualify and the statements of those who rule it valid. He said to them in this formulation: No generation that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya is in its midst, is orphaned.   Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads [kadarvonot]” – Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba said: Just as this goad directs the cow to plow its furrow, so, the words of the wise direct this person to the paths of the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: The Mishna called it marde’a, and the Bible called it darvan and malmad, as it is written: “A cattle goad [malmad]” (Judges 3:31), and likewise, “and to set the goad [darvan]” (I Samuel 13:21). Rabbi Natan said: Why is it called marde’a? It is because it imparts knowledge [moreh de’a] to the cow. Why is it called darvan? It is because it causes understanding to reside [dar bina] in the cow. Why is it called malmad? It is because it teaches [melamed] the cow to plow in its furrow. The same is true of the words of the wise; they cause wisdom to reside in people, impart knowledge in them, and teach them the ways of the Holy One blessed be He. “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – they are implanted in a person when he observes them. Why are they likened to a sapling [netia]? Just as the roots of a tree take root everywhere, so the words of the wise enter and take root throughout the body. “The collectors [asupot] of wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when are they like implanted nails in a person? It is when a master of Torah enters to teach, and they gather [ne’esafim] to hear.   “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – on the first day of the festival, Rabbi Yoḥanan would recite the blessing: Blessed are You, Lord our God, who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us regarding the taking of the palm branch [lulav]. The rest of the days: Regarding the mitzva of the elders. Rabbi Yehoshua would recite the blessing: Regarding the taking of the lulav, each day. Does Rabbi Yehoshua not concede to Rabbi Yoḥanan that the first day is an obligation by Torah law, as it is stated: “You shall take for you on the first day…” (Leviticus 23:40), and the rest of the days are by rabbinic law? Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: That is what Rabbi Yehoshua holds. Why, then, did he do so? It is because it is written: “The words of the wise are like goads…they were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – matters of Torah law and matters of rabbinic law were given from one shepherd.  “More than that, my son, be careful: Making many books without end, and much contemplation is weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). “More than that, my son, be careful” – more than regarding matters of Torah law, be careful regarding matters of rabbinic law. Likewise it says: “As your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2) – the words of the beloved are better than the wine of Torah. Why? It is because one cannot issue halakhic rulings properly on the basis of matters of Torah, because it is vague, and it consists entirely of symbols, as it is stated: “Teach it to the children of Israel; place it [sima] in their mouths” (Deuteronomy 31:19), symbols [simanim] in their mouths. However, from statements of the Sages one can issue halakhic rulings properly, because they explain the Torah. That is why the statements of the Sages are likened to darvanot, because they cause wisdom [medayrin bina] to reside in people.  Another matter: “More than that, my son, be careful” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – Rabbi Abba of Sadronanya said: Were a person to say to you: Why were the statements of the scribes not given written, just as the matters of Torah were given; say to him: It is because it is impossible to write all their statements. That is what is written: “More than that [mehema], my son, be careful.” What is mehema? What [ma] enters you if you come to write the statements of the scribes? Why? It is because were you to write their statements, there is no limit or end to the statements that would enable producing books. That is what is written: “Making many books without end” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). What, then, shall a person do? He shall greatly exert [meyage’a] his flesh to contemplate [lahgot] the statements of the Sages. That is what is written: “And much contemplation [velahag] is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12).  Another matter: “And much contemplation [is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh]” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – if you exerted [yagata] yourself greatly in their statements, the Holy One blessed be He will remove the evil inclination from you. That is what is written: “Flesh,” just as it says: “[I will give you a new heart…and I will remove the stony heart from your flesh]; I will give you a heart of flesh” (Ezekiel 36:26).  Another matter: “And much contemplation [velahag] is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – if you exerted [yagata] yourself greatly in contemplation of the statements of the Sages, the Holy One blessed be He will herald you good tidings [besorot]. That is, “flesh [basar].”  Another matter: If you exerted yourself greatly in the statements of the Sages, you become like a ruler [basar]; that is what is written: “Flesh [basar]” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). Likewise, it says: “Through me [bi] rulers rule [sarim yasoru]” (Proverbs 8:16).  Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads [kadarvonot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen said: A girl’s ball [kadur shel banot], like the sphere that children catch and throw from here to there. The statements of the Sages are the same; this states his reason and that one states his reason. Is it, perhaps, that because this one states one reason and that one says a second reason, perhaps their words are ephemeral? The verse states: “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). It did not say “and like fixed nails,” but rather, “implanted.” Why? It is because he made them like nails, and a nail that has a head is easier to extract. That is why it said: “Like implanted nails.” Roots of a tree that are planted are difficult to uproot. Why are their statements likened to a nail? It is because an iron nail that has a head, even though it is hard, it is easy to extract, and the roots of a tree that are planted even though they are difficult to extract, but they do not have strength like the strength of iron. That is why it is stated: “Like implanted nails”; matters of Torah were accorded the strength of iron and are like the planted roots of a tree.  Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen ben Rabbi said: We read it masmerot, (With the letter samekh.)  but it is written only masmerot. (With the letter sin.)  Just as the priestly and Levite watches [mishmarot] are twenty-four, so the books (Of the Bible.)  are twenty-four. It juxtaposed the statements of the scribes to matters of Torah, that they, like them, are true.  Another matter: “And like [implanted] nails [ukhemasmerot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – masmerot is written; just as the priestly watches are twenty-four, so too, the nails are twenty-four. The question is asked: How many nails need there be in the sandal? (So it would be permitted to wear it on Shabbat.)  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Five, corresponding to the five books of the Torah. Rav Huna said: Seven, as it is stated: “Iron and bronze your padlocks, and all your days, shall be the flow of your oil” (Deuteronomy 33:25). (Your bronze nails in your sandals shall be like your days, seven.)  Rav Aḥa expounded in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Nine. Rabbi would allot eleven on this side and thirteen on that side, the number of priestly watches.   Another matter: “Like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – you affix this nail, and even though you then extract it, its place is recognizable; so, anyone against whom the Sages extend their hand, even if they subsequently accepted him, ultimately he will receive his just deserts at their hand.   Another matter: “Like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when matters of Torah emerge properly from the mouths of their promulgators, they are pleasing to their listeners. “Like implanted nails [kemasmerot]” – when they emerge distorted, they are bitter for their listeners; “kemasmerot” – items that dissolve and are bitter [kemas marot].  “The collectors [asupot] of wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when are matters of Torah implanted in this person? It is when their masters are taken [ne’esafim] from them. As long as his teacher is alive, he could be distracted and say: Whenever I need, my teacher is available to me and I can ask him. When his teacher dies, he must toil day and night to sustain his studies. He knows that he has no one to ask. That is, when is it that they are implanted in this person? It is when their masters are taken [ne’esafim] from them.   “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – even though this one states his reason and that one states his reason, the statements of this one and that one, all of them were given from Moses, what he received from the single One of the universe.  Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – it is taught: From where do you say that if a person heard a matter from an insubstantial one of Israel that it should be in his eyes as though he heard from a Sage of Israel? The verse states: “It will be if you hear My commandments that I command you today” (Deuteronomy 11:13), not as one who hears from the mouth of a Sage, but rather, as one who hears from the mouths of Sages, as it is stated: “The words of the wise are like goads.” Just as this goad directs the cow to its furrows to bring life to the world, so, matters of Torah direct the knowledge of a person to know the Omnipresent. And not as one hears from the mouths of Sages, but rather as one who hears from the mouths of Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “Collectors of wisdom [asupot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). Asupot is nothing other than Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16). And not as one who hears from the mouths of Sanhedrin, but rather, as one who hears from the mouth of Moses, as it is stated: “Were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11), as it is stated: “And His nation remembered the days of old, Moses” (Isaiah 63:11), and it says: “And Moses shepherded” (Exodus 3:1). And not as one who hears from the mouth of Moses, but rather as one who hears from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Were given from one shepherd.” “Shepherd of Israel, listen” (Psalms 80:2) – “one,” as it is stated: “The Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).   It says: “[Your neck is like an ivory tower;] your eyes are pools in Ḥeshbon, by the gate of Bat Rabim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus” (Song of Songs 7:5). “Your eyes” – these are the elders, who are appointed over the congregation. Likewise it says: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and He closed your eyes; [He covered the prophets and your leaders, the seers]” (Isaiah 29:10). (It refers to their leaders as “eyes.”)  “Pools” – just as this pool, a person does not know what is in it, so, a person cannot reckon the statements of the Sages. “In Ḥeshbon” – as their conclusions are drawn through counsel and thought [maḥshava]. Where are these conclusions drawn? It is in the study halls at the gate of Bat Rabim. (Traditionally the courts, including the judges and their disciples, would assemble at the city gates.)  “Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus” – if you fulfill the Torah, aspire to Elijah, to whom I said: “Return on your path to the wilderness of Damascus.” And it says: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant.… Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet…” (Malachi 3:22–23).  “More than that, my son, be careful” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – the Holy One blessed be He said: I have written for you twenty-four books, be careful not to add to them. Why? “Making many books without end” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – anyone who reads a verse that is not from the twenty-four books, it is as though he read the books of heretics. That is, “be careful making many books,” as anyone who does so has no share in the World to Come. That is what is written: “Without end,” just as it says: “But you, go to the end […at the end of the days]” (Daniel 12:13). (End here is taken to refer to the time of salvation. One who is not worthy of salvation does not merit the World to Come.)  You see what is the punishment of one who adds a book. From where is it derived that one who contemplates them becomes wearied  from them? “And much contemplation is weariness of the flesh” – as the flesh will not be roused from the dust, like what we learned: These have no share in the World to Come…and one who reads heretical literature. (Sanhedrin 90a.)   Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – just as this nail that is implanted in the door sustains the boards, so, when the righteous issue a decree, the Holy One blessed be He fulfills their words. Know that it is so from Jacob, as when he blessed Manasseh and Ephraim, he had the younger precede the elder, and the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled his decree. In his regard it is stated: “The words of the wise are kadarvonot” – do not read it as kadarvonot, but rather as kadrabanut, as, when Jacob decreed that the authority [rabanut] would be with Ephraim, the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled his words like an implanted nail. The Holy One blessed be He said: Since Jacob decreed regarding Ephraim that he would be first, I too will place him first regarding all matters: regarding judges, regarding banners, regarding kings, and regarding offerings. Regarding judges, (Judge in the sense of leader, as it is employed in the book of Judges.)  Joshua, as he was a judge: “For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun” (Numbers 13:8); and thereafter, Gideon son of Yo’ash, who was from the tribe of Manasseh. Regarding the banners, “the banner of the camp of Ephraim” (Numbers 2:18), and then, “with it is the tribe of Manasseh” (Numbers 2:20). Regarding kings, Yerovam son of Nevat was from Ephraim, and then Yehu son of Nimshi, from Manasseh. The offerings of the princes, too, when they came to present their offerings: Ephraim presents his offering first, on the seventh day, and Manasseh later, on the eighth day. Accordingly it says: “On the seventh day, prince of the children of Ephraim” and then, “on the eighth day, prince of the children of Manasseh"" (Numbers 7:54). In his [Jacob’s] regard, the verse states: “You will decide something, and He will fulfill it for you” (Job 22:28)."
31,12,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 18:2,"When Rabbi Yehoshua was very old, his students came to visit him. He said to them: My children! What new teachings did you come up with in the house of study? They said to him: We are your students, and we drink from your waters. He said to them: God forbid! This is not a generation without sages! Whose turn was it to speak on the Sabbath? They said: It was Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah’s Sabbath. He said to them: And what was the subject of the day? They said: The commandment to (Deuteronomy 32:2) “gather the whole nation; the men, the women, and the babies” [for a public Torah reading]. He said to them: And what did he speak about? They said to him: This is what he said: The men come to learn, and the women come to hear. But why must the babies come? In order to be able to reward those who bring them. He said to them: You had this pearl of wisdom in your hands, and you wanted to keep it from me? If you had come today only to teach me that one thing, it would have been enough! They said: He also taught about the verse (Ecclesiastes 12:11), “The words of the sages are like goads, like nails fixed in herding sticks.” Just as a goad is used to direct a cow to her furrow, so do words of Torah direct a person toward the paths of life. And lest you think that just as a goad is movable, so words of Torah are easily moved around, it says, “like nails fixed,” to tell you that just as something fixed cannot be uprooted, so too, words of Torah cannot be uprooted. “Herding sticks” refers to the scholars, who gather together to sit in packs. Now, these may prohibit something, and these may permit it; these may say something is impure, and these may say it is pure; these may say something is invalid, and these may say it is valid. [And so perhaps someone will say:] I give up! One cannot learn anything! That is why it says [at the end of the verse], “all given from one shepherd.” One God created them. One leader (i.e., Moses) transmitted them. And the Master of all Things said them: As for you, make your ear like a funnel and take in the words of those who prohibit and the words of those who permit, the words of those who say “impure” and the words of those who say “pure,” the words of those who invalidate and the words of those who validate."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Megillah 1:3:5,"וחגיגה – if a Yom Tov/Jewish holy day falls on Shabbat, we postpone the holiday peace-offerings to the next day, for they have payment all seven days; and similarly הקהל – the gathering together of the people (see Deuteronomy 31:10-13, especially verse 12), when the King would read the book of Deuteronomy/Mishneh Torah, and all the people are liable to come and bring their children, as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:12): “[Gather the people] – men, women, children,[and all strangers in your communities…], and on Shabbat this is impossible and this we postpone it to the next day."
31,13,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Sotah 7:2:6,"ופרשת המלך – this is the portion of ""הקהל""–Gathering the people (see Deuteronomy 31:10-13), as it explains at the end of our chapter (Mishnah 8)."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,Bartenura on Mishnah Kiddushin 1:7:6,"שלא הזמן גרמה – such as Mezuzah, making a railing around the house (Deuteronomy 22:8), a lost object, and sending forth the mother-bird. And these two general principles are not exact/specific: As we hold: we don’t learn from general principles, even in a place where it says regarding them, “except for.” For the [eating of] Matzah on the night of Passover, rejoicing on the festivals and Hakhel (gathering together in Jerusalem – see Deuteronomy 31:12 on the holiday of Sukkot), they are all positive time-bound commandments but women are obligated [in them]. But the [commandments of] Torah study, being fruitful and multiplying, and the redemption of the [first-born] son, which are positive commandments which are not time-bound, and women are exempt [from them]. But the final principle of “all negative commandments, both men and women are obligated, except for [the commandments of] “you shall not round off [the side-growth on your head]” (Leviticus 19:27), nor “destroy the side-growth of your beard” (ibid.,) nor defile yourself to the dead (Leviticus 21:1). This general principle is exact, and we derive it as it is written (Numbers 5:6): “[Speak to the Israelites:] When a man or a woman commits any wrong towards a fellow man…” The Bible compares a woman to a man in all the punishments that are in the Torah."
31,12,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Pesach, Festival Prayers 12","People are accustomed to reading the Song of Songs on the Festival of Matzot because it speaks about the salvation from Egypt, which is the beginning of the subjugation of Israel and their first redemption. As it is stated (Song of Songs 1:9), ""To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots."" And they are also accustomed to read Ruth on the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), because it is written in it (Ruth 1:22), ""at the beginning of the barley harvest"" - and [Shavuot] is the the time of the harvest. And there is another reason: Because our ancestors only accepted the Torah and entered the covenant through circumcision, immersion and the sprinkling of blood [at that time], as it is found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz; and Ruth also converted, as it is stated (Ruth 1:16), ""for where you go, I shall go."" And from the answer of Ruth, we know what Noami said to her. As she said to her, ""It is prohibited for us [to go beyond] the Shabbat perimeter."" [She answered,] ""Where you go, I shall go"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Isolation [with a stranger of the opposite sex] is forbidden to us."" ""Where you lodge, I shall lodge"" (Ruth 1:16). ""We are commanded to observe six hundred and thirteen commandments."" ""Your people are my people"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Idolatrous worship is forbidden to us."" ""Your God is my God"" (Ruth 1:16). ""Four types of capital punishment were handed over to the court."" ""Where you die, I shall die"" (Ruth 1:17). ""Two burial grounds were set up for the court, one for those burnt and stoned and another for those executed and strangled."" ""And there I shall be buried"" (Ruth 1:17). So is it found in the chapter [entitled] HaCholetz (Yevamot 47b). And we are hence accustomed to reading Ruth on  the Holiday of Weeks. And also on the Festival of Shemini Atzeret (Assembly of the Eighth), it is customary to read Ecclesiastes, because in it, it is written (Ecclesiastes 11:1), ""Distribute portions to seven or even to eight"" - these [correspond to] the seven days of the Festival (Sukkot) and the Festival of the Assembly of the Eighth. I mean to say, because it is the holiday of the reaping, to warn about the tithes and the priestly tithes and the pledges, such that they not transgress, ""you shall not delay,"" [past] the three festivals. And there is another reason - because King Shlomo said it on the Festival (Sukkot) during the assembly (hakhel). As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:10-12), ""at the appointed time of the year of remission, during the Sukkot festival;  When all of Israel comes to be seen, etc. Assemble (Hakhel) the people; the men and the women and the infants, etc."" And it is [also] written (I Kings 8:2), ""they assembled before King Shlomo in the month of Etanim during the festival, etc."" So he said it then in the assembly, to rebuke Israel. Hence it is fit to say it during [this] festival. All of this was written by Ibn HaYarchi (R. Avraham ben Natan). And they said in Tractate Soferim (14:3), ""One who reads from Ruth, the Song of Songs, Lamentations and from the Scroll of Esther must [recite the blessing that concludes], 'concerning the reading of the Megillah' - even though it is included in the Writings. One who reads from the Writings must recite, 'Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, [who has sanctified us with Your commandments and has commanded us] to read in the Holy Writings.'"" "
31,13,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Devarim, The Teacher as Hero 17","Indeed, the last two commands Moses gave the Israelites were explicitly educational in nature: to gather the entire people together in the seventh year to hear the Torah being read, to remind them of their covenant with God (Deut. 31:12–13), and, “Write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the people of Israel” (31:19), understood as the command that each person must write for himself a scroll of the law."
31,12,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Shoftim, The Three Crowns 12","The king recruited an army, levied taxes, and was responsible for civic order. It was his task to defend the nation from enemies outside and lawlessness within. He was immersed in the demands of statecraft. He was a civil rather than religious leader. Nonetheless it was the king to whom tradition attached the command of reading the Law – sections of the book of Deuteronomy – at the national gathering every seven years (Deut. 31:12), thus ensuring that the people did not forget its covenant with God."

Assemble the ­people – men, women, and children, and the strangers living in your towns – so they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.

A thousand years later, when Athens experimented with democracy, only a limited section of society had political rights. Women, children, slaves and foreigners were excluded.

31,13,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:13:1,"ובניהם אשר לא ידעו, ""and their children, who do not know, etc."" This division is in line with mention of ""and the children"" in verse 12 as part of the מצוה of הקהל. Moses says that although he is aware that the children are too young to understand what they would hear at that assembly, they are not too young to learn to fear G'd, i.e. one must train them in יראת השם from an early age. "
31,13,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:13:1","ובניהם אשר לא ידעו ישמעו ולמדו ליראה, “and their children who do not know of this will learn and be in awe, etc.;” when they will hear about it and ask their parents who will instruct them in all aspects of Judaism and Jewish history. The word טף, frequently used to describes babies, in this case speaks of children that are already older and that can be taught. In the previous verse the Torah wrote:ילמדו ויראו, ”they will learn and be in awe,” instead of “they will learn to be in awe.” Our sages do not understand the word טף here as referring to children of school-going age, but to infants, and they explain that the reasons that the mothers were to bring them along was to receive a reward for their efforts.
"
31,13,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:13:2,"This is the reason why Moses changed the sequence in which he described this process. Whereas in verse 12 he had said ילמדו ויראו they would ""learn and (as a result) fear,"" in this verse he says ""they will learn to fear."" Being present at such an experience as הקהל is inspirational even for young children and inspires fear of G'd. Moses adds the comment כל הימים, ""all the days,"" to remind us that when fear of G'd is instilled in children at an early age it will last them all their lives."
31,13,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:13:3,"Our sages (Chagigah 3) ask why the women had to drag their children along for this assembly, and they answer ""in order to receive credit for complying with the instruction."" Presumably they referred to those children who could not even appreciate that their elders were listening to the Torah, i.e. the babies in arms. They must have understood that Moses' reason for bringing them applied only to children who were already somewhat older."
31,13,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:2","It is a positive mitzva to assemble all of Israel – men, women, and children – on Sukkot at the end of each Shemita year, during their pilgrimage to the Temple. Sections of the Torah that encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance are then read to them, as it is written: And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year, at the time of the Shemita year, at the Festival of Sukkot, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God in the place that He will choose, you shall read this Torah aloud in the presence of all Israel. Assemble (Hak’hel) the people – men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities – that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Torah. Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere the Lord your God as long as they live, in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.

31,13,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Sukkot 8:1:4","Every participant benefited greatly from Hak’hel. Those able to study Torah in depth were inspired to increase their study. Those able to listen and understand were inspired to listen avidly to the Torah’s words and to live by them. Children who were old enough to understand listened to the words, and the sanctity of the occasion inspired and encouraged them to study Torah and keep mitzvot. As for those children who were too young to understand, their souls absorbed the tremendous value and incomparable importance of Torah, when they saw that everyone was gathering together to hear it. Their parents were inspired too, recognizing the monumental mission incumbent upon them: to educate their children to Torah and mitzvot (Ramban on Devarim 31:12-13; Maharal, Gur Aryeh, ad loc.; see Harḥavot)."
31,13,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:13:1,"AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN, WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN, MAY HEAR, AND LEARN TO FEAR. This refers to the little children [mentioned in the preceding verse], for they will hear and inquire, and the fathers will accustom them [to the words of the Law] and educate them. For the little children [mentioned here] are not those who suckle at the breasts, but rather the young in years who are nearly old enough to be educated, this being the sense of the expression and learn to fear — in the future [when they are grown up]. But above [when speaking of the men and the women] he stated, that they may learn, and fear (Verse 12.)  [now, since they are adults]. However, our Rabbis have said, (Chagigah 3a.)  “The men came to learn, and the women to listen. And the little children — why did they come? In order to reward those who bring them.” (From this text it appears that the Rabbis understood the term little children as applying to the very young who are not yet old enough to ask questions.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

And with regard to all positive mitzvot that are not time bound, both men and women are obligated to perform them.

According to the Babylonian system, the Torah is divided into fifty-four sections called sedarim, and the reading ends on a regular date. (Herman, Ma’agal ha-hagim.)  According to the method practiced in Eretz Yisrael, the Torah is divided into 154 sedarim. Some think that the three-and-a-half-year cycle had no relation to the yearly calendar, and apparently it was not uniform. Others assert that there were different customs for completing the three-and-a-half-year cycle, and the finishing point was not uniform. Still, the Jews united to complete the cycle together every seven years, in order to complete the reading at the Hakhel gathering at the end of the Shemitah year on Sukkot. (Deuteronomy 31:1–13.) "

And if the Day of Assembly (see Deuteronomy 31:10-13 – which commands the Jewish people to assemble in the Temple courtyard once every seven years to hear the public reading of the book of Deuteronomy during the Festival of Sukkot following the Sabbatical year) falls on Shabbat, the Reading [of the Torah] will be on Sunday.

31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:1,"“The Lord said to Moses: Behold, your days are approaching to die; summon Joshua, and stand in the Tent of Meeting and I will command him. Moses and Joshua went, and stood in the Tent of Meeting” (Deuteronomy 31:14).  “The Lord said to Moses: Behold, your days are approaching” – halakha, a person of Israel whose deceased relative is laid out before him, what is the ruling; is it permitted for him to pray? So, the Sages taught: One whose deceased relative is laid out before him is exempt from the recitation of Shema and from the Amida prayer. Why did our Rabbis teach us this? Since he sees his trouble before him, his mind is muddled. But once he is buried, all seven days of mourning, he is obligated for every possible matter of mitzva. From where do you derive that mourning is seven days? Rabbi Abba bar Avina said: As we found regarding Joseph: “He observed mourning for his father seven days” (Genesis 50:10), and Shabbat is included in the count. Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida said in the name of Reish Lakish: You should derive it from another place. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I will transform your festivals into mourning” (Amos 8:10) – just as the days of the festival are seven, (This is a reference to a seven day festival. See Moed Katan 20a, which relates to the fact that Shavuot is  a one day festival.)  so the days of mourning are seven.  Our Rabbis said: There was an incident during the days of Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta, who went to a circumcision. The father of the baby made a feast, and gave them to drink wine that was aged seven years. He said to them: ‘I am aging from this wine for the wedding feast of my son.’ They were feasting until midnight. Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta, who was confident in his strength, departed at midnight to go to his city. He encountered the angel of death there on the way, and saw that he looked strange. He said to him: ‘Who are you?’ He said to him: ‘The emissary of the Omnipresent.’ He said to him: ‘Why do you look strange?’ He said to him: ‘It is due to the conversation of the people, who say: This and that we intend to do, but they do not know when they will be called to die. That man with whom you were dining, and [who] said to you: I am aging from this wine for the wedding feast of my son? The time for him (The son.)  to be taken will be reached after thirty days.’ He said to him: ‘Show me my time.’ He said to him: ‘I do not have control over you, and over those like you. At times, the Holy One blessed be He desires good deeds and adds life to you, as it is stated: “The fear of the Lord will add days”’ (Proverbs 10:27). The Rabbis said: The death of the righteous is onerous before the Holy One blessed be He. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Weighty in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His pious ones” (Psalms 116:15). Know that He should have said to Moses: “Behold, you are going to die,” but He did not say so. Instead, He forsook him and attributed his death to the days. From where is it derived? It is from what we read regarding the matter: “Behold, your days are approaching to die.”"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:2,"What the verse said: “I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift…” (Ecclesiastes 9:11). What is “that the race is not to the swift”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: This verse is speaking about Moses. How so? Yesterday, he would ascend to the heavens like an eagle; now, he seeks to cross the Jordan, but is unable to do so, as it is stated: “As you will not cross this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27). “And the war is not to the valiant” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) – yesterday the angels were trembling before him, but now he says: “For I was daunted due to the wrath and the fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19). “Also not to the wise is bread” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) – yesterday, “The wise man goes up against the city of the mighty and removes the strength of its stronghold” (Proverbs 21:22); from Heaven, but now, it was taken from him and given to Joshua son of Nun. “And also not to the clever is wealth” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) – yesterday, he spoke like a wealthy man: “Relent from Your enflamed wrath” (Exodus 32:12), “please pardon the iniquity of this people” (Numbers 14:19). But now he is speaking like an indigent man: “I pleaded [vaetḥanan]” (Deuteronomy 3:23) – do it for me for nothing [ḥinam]. “And also not to the knowledgeable is favor” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) – yesterday, he knew how to appease his Creator: “Arise, Lord” (Numbers 10:35), “repose, Lord” (Numbers 10:36), but here, after he pleaded for all of seven days, ultimately the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Your days are approaching.”"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:3,"What the verse said: “There is no person who rules the spirit, to retain the spirit” (Ecclesiastes 8:8) – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: There is no person who rules the angel of death, to keep him from him, and spirit [ruaḥ] is nothing other than an angel [malakh], as it is stated: “He makes the winds [ruḥot] His messengers [malakhav]” (Psalms 104:4). Rabbi Neḥemya says: There is no person who rules the ruaḥ of the exiles, to eliminate them from the world, and ruaḥ is nothing other than exiles, as it is stated: “And behold, the four winds [ruhot] of the heavens” (Daniel 7:2). (Daniel proceeds to enumerate the four exiles.)  Another matter, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: There is no person who rules over his soul to eliminate it. Why? It is because the Holy One blessed be He disseminated it throughout the body, as had the Holy One blessed be He disseminated it in one limb, when trouble would befall a person, he would amputate that limb and die. That is why it is throughout the body, so that he will not be able to eliminate it. That is, “there is no person who rules the spirit.”  What is, “there is no sending a proxy in war”? (Ecclesiastes 8:8). A person cannot say, when he is tending toward death: ‘Behold, I am sending my slave in my stead.’ Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta says: A person cannot craft a weapon and save himself from the angel of death, like the matter that is stated: “And made weapons and shields in abundance” (II Chronicles 32:5). What is “there is no dominion over the day of death”? There is no person with dominion to say: ‘Wait for me until I settle my accounts or until I give orders to my household, and then I will come.’  Another matter, what is “there is no dominion”? The angel of death does not say: ‘Since this one is a king, we will concede to him an additional day or two days.’ There is no favoritism before him on that day. Know that all the days of David, he was called king, as it is stated: “King David was old” (I Kings 1:1). When he reached his death, kingship is not written in his regard. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The days of David approached to die” (I Kings 2:1). “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” (Ecclesiastes 8:8) – a person cannot pose an appeal before him [the angel of death], nor can a person make a claim before him. After all, Moses, after all the goodness that he saw, once the day of his death arrived, he was unable to delay it. He immediately said to him: “Behold, your days are approaching to die.”"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:4,"Another matter, Moses said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, after all the glory and all the bravery that my eyes saw, will I die?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, “Who is the man who lives and does not see death…?”’ (Psalms 89:49). What is “who is the man who lives”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Who is a man like Abraham, who descended into the fiery furnace and was saved? But then, “Abraham expired and died” (Genesis 25:8). Who is a man like Isaac, who outstretched his neck on the altar? But then he said: “Behold, I have now grown old; I do not know the day of my death” (Genesis 27:2). Who is a man like Jacob, who encountered the angel? But then, “the time of Israel approached to die” (Genesis 47:29). Who is a man like Moses, who spoke to his Creator face to face? But then, “behold, your days are approaching to die.”"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:6,"Another matter, “behold [hen], your days are approaching” – why was death decreed upon him with this expression, hen? The Rabbis say: To what is the matter comparable? It is to one who honored the king and brought him a gift, a sharp sword. The king said: ‘Behead him with it.’ That person said to him: ‘My lord the king, with what I honored you, you are beheading me?’ So, Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, I lauded you with hen, as so it is written: “Behold [hen], to the Lord your God are the heavens, and the heavens of heavens…” (Deuteronomy 10:14), and with hen you are decreeing death upon me?’  The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘A bad neighbor sees the incomes but does not see the expenditures.’ He said to him: ‘Do you not remember when I sent you to redeem them from Egypt, and you said to me: “But, behold [hen], they will not believe me”?’ (Exodus 4:1). That is, “behold [hen], your days are approaching.”"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:7,"Another matter, Rabbi Avin said: What is hen? To what is the matter comparable? It is to a certain noblewoman who crafted a high quality purple garment for the king. The king took it and stored it. When the time arrived for the woman to die, the king said: ‘Let her take that purple garment with which she honored me.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘You lauded Me with hen, with hen I decree death upon you.’"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:8,"Another matter, to what is the matter comparable? It is to a pregnant woman who was incarcerated in prison. She bore a son there. That child grew up there. The king passed before the prison. That child began shouting: ‘My lord the king, why am I incarcerated in the prison?’ The king said to him: ‘It is due to the sin of your mother that you are placed here.’ So Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, there are thirty-six instances of karet for which a person who violates one of them incurs liability to die. Did I, perhaps, violate one of them? Why are You decreeing death upon me?’ He said to him: ‘Due to the sin of Adam the first man you are dying, as he brought death to the world.’ Hen, what is hen? Due to the iniquity of the one in whose regard hen is written: “Behold [hen], the man has become as one of us…” (Genesis 3:22)."
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 9:9,"Another matter, what is hen? Rabbi Sima said: The day raised a grievance before the Holy One blessed be He. It said: ‘Master of the universe, I will not move and will not set, as long as Moses is alive.’ (Since the day had arrived for Moses to die and for Joshua to take over, metaphorically the day would not end before the transition took place (Etz Yosef).)   Another matter, the Rabbis said: Since Moses knew that he was supposed to die on that day, what did he do? Rabbi Yanai said: He wrote thirteen Torah scrolls; twelve for the twelve tribes, and one, he placed in the Ark, so that if one would seek to falsify a matter, they would be able to find the one that is in the Ark. Moses said: ‘By means of me being engaged in the Torah, which is all life, the day will set and the decree will be nullified.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He signaled to the sun, but it stood obstinate against Him. It said: ‘I will not set as long as Moses exists in this world.’ That is why Job said: “Truly, I wept for the downtrodden [keshe yom], [my soul grieved for the indigent]” (Job 30:25) – as the day was obstinate [nitkasha] against Him. (Job is saying that he wept for Moses, who died after the day was obstinate before God.)  “Hen” – what is “behold, your days are approaching”? It is like a person who says to another: ‘So-and-so filed a grievance against you before the king.’  “Summon Joshua” – he [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, let Joshua take my kingdom, but I will live.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Act to him just as he acts to you.’ Immediately, Moses awakened and went to Joshua’s residence. Joshua became afraid, and Moses said: ‘My master, come to me.’ They went out to walk. Moses walked to Joshua’s left. They entered the Tent of Meeting. The pillar of cloud descended and partitioned between them. When the pillar of cloud ascended, Moses went to Joshua and said: ‘What did the Divine Speech say to you?’ Joshua said to him: ‘When the Divine Speech was revealed to you, would I know what it was speaking with you?’ (Just like Moses did not report to Joshua on everything that God spoke to him, similarly Joshua would not report to Moses.)  At that moment, Moses shouted and said: ‘One hundred deaths, but not one [instance of] jealousy.’ Solomon articulated it: “As love is as intense as death, jealousy is as cruel as the grave” (Song of Songs 8:6) – the love that Moses loved Joshua, and the fact that Moses was jealous of Joshua. Once he accepted that he would die, the Holy One blessed be He began to placate him. He said to him: ‘In this world, you led My children. In the future, too, I will lead them through you.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “He remembered the days of old, Moses, His people” (Isaiah 63:11)."
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:8,"When the time arrived for Moses to take his leave of the world, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Behold, your time [to die] is approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, after all this exertion, You say to me: “Behold your time…is approaching”? “Let me not die, but live, and I will relate the deeds of the Lord”’ (Psalms 118:17). He said to him: ‘You cannot, “for that is all of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, I request of You one matter before my death, that I will enter, (Let me enter the Land of Israel.)  and all the gates of the heavens and the depths will be split, and everybody will see that there is none but You.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You will know this day, and restore to your heart [that the Lord, He is the God]…there is no other” (Deuteronomy 4:39). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You said: “There is no other.” I, too, say: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses…with all the signs and the wonders…and with all the great awe, that Moses performed before the eyes of all Israel”’ (Deuteronomy 34:10–12)."
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:9,"“Behold [hen], your time to die is approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14) – Rabbi Aivu said: Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, with the matter that I lauded you in the midst of sixty myriad sanctifiers of Your name, (""Behold [hen] the heavens and the heavens of the heavens belong to the Lord your God"" (Deuteronomy 10:14). This was said to Israel, who numbered sixty myriad (See Numbers 26:51).)  with that You decreed death upon me, as it is stated:  “Behold, your time to die is approaching” – all measures dispensed by the Holy One blessed be He, are dispensed measure for measure. But this is an evil measure for a good measure, a lacking measure for a full measure, a restricted measure for an ample measure.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘This, too, is a good measure, that I said “behold [hen]” to you, as it is stated: “Behold [hineh], I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:20); “behold [hen], restitution will be made to the righteous” (Proverbs 11:31); “behold [hineh], I am sending Elijah the prophet to you” (Malachi 3:23). Just as you exalted Me over sixty myriads, so, I will exalt you in the future in the midst of fifty-five myriads of full-fledged righteous ones, as it is stated: Hen, this is the numerical value of hen: Heh – five, nun – fifty.’"
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:10,"Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Ten “deaths” are written in Moses’s regard, and these are: “Behold, your time to die is approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14); “die on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 32:50); “for I will die ” (Deuteronomy 4:22); “for I know, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:29); “and so, too, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:27); “before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1); “one hundred and tweny years old upon his death” (Deuteronomy 34:7); “Moses, the servant of God, died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5); “it was after Moses’s death” (Joshua 1:1); “Moses My servant died” (Joshua 1:2). It teaches that as many as ten times it was decreed against him that he would not enter the Land of Israel, but his harsh sentence was not sealed until the High Court (The supernal High Court.)  revealed itself to him. He [God] said to him: ‘It is a decree from before Me that you will not cross,’ as it is stated: “For you will not cross the Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27). This matter was not consequential in Moses’s eyes, as he said: ‘Israel performed great sins several times, and when I asked for mercy, He immediately accepted it from Me, as it is stated: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). What is written there? “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14). “I will smite them with the pestilence, and I will destroy them” (Numbers 14:12). What is written there? “The Lord said: “I have pardoned…” (Numbers 14:20); I, who have not sinned since my youth, all the more so that when I pray for myself, He will accept it from me.’   When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the matter was inconsequential in Moses’s eyes, and that he was not standing in prayer, He immediately seized the opportunity and took an oath in His great Name that he [Moses] would not enter the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “Therefore [lakhen], you will not bring this assembly [into the land that I have given them]” (Numbers 20:12), and lakhen is nothing other than an oath, as it is stated: “Therefore, I have taken an oath to the house of Eli” (I Samuel 3:14).  When Moses saw that his sentence had been sealed, he decreed a fast upon himself, drew a small circle, stood within it, and said: ‘I am not moving from here until You void this decree.’ At that moment, what did Moses do? He donned sackcloth, wrapped himself in sackcloth, covered himself with ashes, and stood in prayer and supplication before the Holy One blessed be He, until the heavens, the earth, and the order of Creation shook violently, and they said: ‘Perhaps, the desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has arrived.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has not arrived. Rather: “In whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man”’ (Job 12:10), and man is no one other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses was very humble, more than any person on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3). What did the Holy One blessed be He do at that moment? He proclaimed at each and every gate of each and every firmament and each and every court that they should not accept Moses’ prayer and they should not take it up before Him, because the decree had been sealed in his regard. The angel who is appointed over proclamation, his name is Akazriel. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called in a frenzy, and said to the ministering angels: ‘Descend in a frenzy and lock the gates of each and every firmament,’ as the voice of the prayer was forcing its way upward to the firmament due to the sound of Moses’s prayer, as his prayer was like a sword that rips and cuts and cannot be delayed. His prayer was like the ineffable Name that he learned from Zagzael, the master scribe of the residents of the upper world.  Regarding that moment it says: “A wind lifted me, and I heard behind me the sound of a great noise [raash]: Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12). Raash is nothing other than quaking, and great is nothing other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses, too, was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people” (Exodus 11:3). What is “blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place”? When the wheels of the divine chariot and the seraphs of fire saw that the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Do not accept Moses’s prayer,’ and He did not show him favor, did not grant him life, and did not allow him to enter the Land of Israel, they said: “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place,” as there is no favoritism, neither for the small nor the great.  From where is it derived that Mosed prayed during that period five hundred and fifteen times? It is as it is stated: “I pleaded [vaetḥanan] with the Lord at that time, saying” (Deuteronomy 3:23) – that is the numerical value of vaetḥanan. (Vav – 6, alef – 1, tav – 400, ḥet – 8, nun – 50, nun sofit – 50.)  At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is revealed and known before You, my exertion, and the suffering that I underwent for Israel, until they would believe in Your Name. How much suffering I underwent for them regarding the mitzvot, until I bolstered the Torah and the mitzvot in them? I said: Just as I saw their trouble, so, I will see their well-being, but now, when the well-being of Israel has arrived, You say to me: “You will not cross this Jordan”? You are rendering Your Torah a forgery, as it is written: “On his day you shall give his wage, and the sun shall not set upon it as he is poor, and he anticipates it, lest he cry out against you to the Lord and it will be a sin in you” (Deuteronomy 24:15). Is this payment for the work of forty years that I toiled, until they would become a sacred and loyal people? As it is stated: “But Judah still ruled with God, and he is faithful to the Holy One” (Hosea 12:1).  The wicked angel Samael was the head of all the accusing angels. Each moment, he would count toward Moses’s death and say: ‘When will the end arrive, the moment when Moses will die, so I can descend and take his soul from him?’ In his regard, David said: “The wicked man looks upon the righteous man and seeks to kill him” (Psalms 37:32). You have none among the accusing angels as wicked as Samael, and you have none among the prophets as righteous as Moses, as it is stated: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). To what is the matter comparable? It is to a person who happened upon the feast of a bride and groom, and that person was anticipating and saying: ‘When will their rejoicing arrive and I will rejoice in it?’  So, the wicked Samael was anticipating Moses’s soul, and saying: ‘When will Mikhael (Mikhael is the ministering angel of Israel. See Daniel 12:1, Yoma 77a.)  weep and I will fill my mouth with laughter?’ Until Mikhael said to him: ‘What, wicked one, will I weep and you laugh? “Do not rejoice, my enemy, over me; though I fell, I will rise; though I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me”’ (Micah 7:8). “Though I fell” – due to Moses’ passing, “I will rise” – due to Joshua’s leadership, when he toppled the thirty-one kings. (See Joshua 12:7–24.)  “Though I sit in darkness” – with the destruction of the first and latter Temple, “the Lord is a light for me” – in the messianic era.’  Up to this point, one hour had passed. At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me in this world, and I will live and not die.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘If I do not kill you in this world, how will I revive you in the World to Come? Moreover, you will render My Torah a forgery, as it is written in My Torah by your hand: “There is no deliverer from My hand”’ (Deuteronomy 32:39).  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me like the beasts of the field, who eat greenery, drink water, live, and see the world. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you, [do not continue to speak to Me of this matter]” (Deuteronomy 3:26). He said before him: ‘Master of the universe, if not, leave me in this world, like this bird that flies in all directions of the world, and gathers its sustenance each day, and in the evening it returns to its nest. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you.” What is “enough for you”? He said to him: ‘It is enough for you what you have spoken.’ When Moses saw that no creature could save him from the path of death, at that moment, he said: “The Rock, His actions are perfect, as all His ways are justice; a faithful God and there is no injustice, righteous and upright is He” (Deuteronomy 32:4).  What did Moses do? He took the scroll and wrote on it the ineffable Name and the book of the song. (The song of Haazinu (Deuteronomy 32).)  But he did not yet complete it until the moment arrived for Moses to die. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said to Gavriel: ‘Gavriel, go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, one who is the equivalent of sixty myriads, how can I see his death? And one who possesses these qualities, how can I act toward him with fury?’ Then He said to Mikhael: ‘Go out and bring Moses soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I was his teacher, and he was my disciple, and I am not able to see his death.’ Then He said to the wicked Samael: ‘Go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ Immediately, he clothed himself in anger and girded himself with a sword, wrapped himself in cruelty, and went toward Moses. When he saw him that he was sitting and writing the ineffable Name, [that] the aura of his appearance was like the sun, and [that] he resembled an angel of the Lord of hosts, Samael grew fearful of Moses. He said: ‘The angels can certainly not take Moses’ soul.’ Before Samael showed himself to Moses, Moses knew that Samael had come. When Samael saw Moses, a fearful trembling seized him, like the pangs of a woman giving birth, and he was unable to open his mouth to speak to Moses, until Moses said to Samael: ‘“There is no peace, said the Lord, for the wicked” (Isaiah 48:22); what are you doing here?’ He said to him: ‘I came to take your soul.’ He said to him: ‘Who sent you?’ He said to him: ‘The One who created all the creations.’ He said to him: ‘You will not take my soul.’ He said to him: ‘Anyone who comes into the world, their souls are given to me.’ He said to him: ‘'I have greater strength than anyone [else] who comes into the world.’   He said to him: ‘What is your strength?’ He said to him: ‘I am the son of Amram, I emerged circumcised from my mother’s womb, and there was no need to circumcise me. On the day that I was born, I was able to speak, I walked on my feet, I spoke with my father and my mother, and I did not even suck milk. When I was three months old, I prophesied and said that I was destined to receive the Torah from fiery flames. When I was walking outside, I entered the king’s palace and took the crown from upon his head. When I was eighty years old, I performed signs and wonders in Egypt: I took out sixty myriads before the eyes of all Egypt; I split the sea into twelve sections; I sweetened the water of Mara; I ascended and trod a path in the heavens; I engaged in the battle of the angels; I received a Torah of fire; I resided under a throne of fire; took shelter under a pillar of fire; I spoke with Him face to face; I prevailed over the heavenly entourage; I revealed their secrets to humankind; I received Torah from the right [hand] of the Holy One blessed be He, and taught it to Israel. I waged war with Siḥon and with Og, two mighty idol worshippers, who during the Flood, the water did not reach their ankles due to their height. I caused the sun and the moon to stand still in the heights, and I struck them with the staff in my hand and I killed them. Who is there among those who come into the world who can do that? Go from here, wicked one, you must not say that. (That you came to take my soul.)  Go, flee from before me, I will not give my soul to you.’  Immediately, Samael returned and brought the response before the Almighty. The Holy One blessed be He said to Samael: 'Come and bring Moses’ soul.' He immediately drew his sword from his scabbard and stood over Moses. Moses immediately became furious at him, took in his hand his staff, on which the ineffable Name was inscribed, and smote Samael with all his strength, until he fled from before him. He pursued him with the ineffable Name, and removed the beam of glory from between his eyes and blinded his eyes. Until this point, Moses was successful. A moment later, a Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The end, your death, has arrived.’  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, remember that day that You revealed Yourself to me at the bush, and said to me: “And now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and take My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt”? (Exodus 3:10). Remember that day that I was standing upon Mount Sinai for forty days and forty night? I ask You, please, do not hand me over to the angel of death.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: ‘Fear not, I, Myself, will tend to you and to your burial.’ At that moment, Moses stood and sanctified himself, like the seraphs.   The Holy One blessed be He descended from the uppermost heavens of heavens to take Moses’ soul, and there were three ministering angels with him: Mikhael, Gavriel, and Zagzagel: Mikhael prepared Moses’ bier, Gavriel spread a fine linen cloth at his head, and Zagzagel at his feet. Mikhael on one side and Gavriel on one side. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Cover your eyes with your eyelids’ and he covered his eyes with his eyelids. He said to him: ‘Place your hands on your chest,’ and he placed his hands on his chest. He said to him: ‘Place your feet one next to the other.’ He placed his feet one next to the other.   At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He summoned the soul from within his body. He said to it: ‘My daughter, one hundred and twenty years I allotted for your being in Moses’ body. Now, your end has arrived, it is time to leave. Depart, do not delay.’ It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I know that You are the God of all the spirits and all the souls. The soul of the living and the dead  are given into Your hand. You created me, You formed me, and you placed me in Moses’ body for one hundred and twenty years. Now, is there a body in the world purer than Moses’s body? As no putrid wind was ever seen in him, and no worms or maggots. That is why I love it and do not wish to depart from it.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Soul, depart, do not delay, and I will take you up to the uppermost heavens of heavens, I will seat you beneath My Throne of Glory with the cherubs, the seraphs, and the troops.’ (Troops of angels.)    It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from near your Divine Presence on High, two angels, Uza and Azael, descended and lusted after earthly women and corrupted their way on the earth until you suspended them between the earth and the heavens. But the son of Amram, from the day that You revealed Yourself to him, he did not consort with his wife, as it is stated: “Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses with regard to the Kushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Kushite woman” (The midrash here is based on the interpretation that they were talking about the fact that Moses abstained from being with his wife. See Rashi on Numbers 12:1.)  (Numbers 12:1). I ask You please: Leave me in Moses’ body.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He kissed him, and took his soul with a kiss on the mouth.   The Holy One blessed be He began weeping: “Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against the evildoers?” (Psalms 94:16). And the Divine Presence says: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10). The heavens weep and say: “The pious one is lost from the land” (Micah 7:2). The earth weeps and says: “The upright among men is no more” (Micah 7:2). When Joshua sought his master but did not find him, he was weeping and saying: “Help, Lord, for the faithful man is no more, for trustworthiness has disappeared from among men” (Psalms 12:2). The ministering angels say: “He executed the righteousness of God” (Deuteronomy 33:21), and Israel said: “And His ordinances with Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:21). These and those were saying: “May he come in peace, may they rest on their resting places, one who walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2).   “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7), and his soul for life in the World to Come. Amen, so, may it be His will. “Blessed be the Lord forever, amen and amen” (Psalms 89:53)."
31,14,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"THAT I MAY GIVE HIM [Joshua] A CHARGE. “This means that I may exhort him.” This is Rashi’s language. But there is no need for this, because G-d’s statement [to Joshua] for thou shalt bring [the children of Israel into the Land] (Further, Verse 23.)  is a command, and, if he were to be indolent and not do so, he would be liable to the death-penalty. It is possible that the meaning of that I may give him a charge is that I will appoint him a prince and commander (Isaiah 55:4.)  over Israel, and thou shalt give him a charge in their sight. (Numbers 27:19.) "
31,14,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"ואצונו means, THAT I MAY EXHORT HIM."
31,14,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"THY DAYS APPROACH THAT THOU MUST DIE. For there is a time set for each and everyone. (To pass away.)  I have previously explained this. (See I.E. on Ex. 23:26 (Vol. 2, p. 518).) "
31,14,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:14:2,"AND MOSES…WENT. From the camp of Israel, for that is where he was. (When he took leave of and blessed Israel.)  He then came to the camp where God’s presence rested."
31,14,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 31:14,"Adonoy said to Moshe, ‘‘Look! Your time is approaching to die. Call Yehoshua and present yourselves in Ohel Moed and I shall exhort him.’’ Moshe went with Yehoshua and they presented themselves in Ohel Moed."
31,14,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 31:14,"Unto three of the just was it told that the time of their death was drawing nigh, and that they should not attain to the days of their fathers; and each of them had been appointed a prince in his days; Jakob our father, David the king, and Mosheh the prophet; for thus it is written: And the Lord said unto Mosheh, Behold, thy day approacheth when thou must die. Call Jehoshua, and stand both of you in the tabernacle of ordinance, that I may give him charge. And Mosheh and Jehoshua went, and stood in the tabernacle of ordinance. 
"
31,14,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"הן קרבו ימיך למות, ""Behold, your days are drawing near to die, etc."" The reason for the word הן here is to justify Moses' having said that he had reached his 120th birthday on that day. Our sages in Rosh Hashanah 11 mention that by the word היום in verse 2 Moses meant that he reached the age allotted to him. As a result, G'd's word came to him saying: הן, ""you are correct,"" the time has come for you to die. The reason G'd said קרבו ימיך (pl.) instead of saying קרב יומך, ""your day has arrived (sing.)"" may be understood in the same vein as Genesis 47,29 where we have explained this wording."
31,14,Midrash,Kohelet Rabbah 7:13:1,"“See the work of God, for who can mend what He has warped?” (Ecclesiastes 7:13) “See the work of God, for who can mend what He has warped?” When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He took him and showed him all the trees in the Garden of Eden, and He said to him: ‘See My creations, how beautiful and exemplary they are. Everything I created, I created for you. Make certain that you do not ruin and destroy My world, as if you destroy it, there will be no one to mend it after you. Moreover, you will cause death to that righteous one.’ (Moses.)  To what is the matter of [the death of] Moses our master analogous? [It is analogous] to a pregnant woman who was incarcerated in prison. She gave birth to a son, raised him, and she died there. Sometime later the king passed the entrance of the prison. As the king was passing, that son began screaming and he said: ‘My lord the king, I was born here, I grew up here; I do not know due to what sin am I placed here.’ [The king] said to him: ‘Due to your mother’s sin.’ So too regarding Moses, as it is written: “Behold, the man has become like one [of us]” (Genesis 3:22). And it is written: “Behold, your days are drawing near to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). (The verse in Genesis was stated by God in explaining His removal of Adam from the Garden of Eden following his sin. The verbal analogy to the verse in Deuteronomy, which relates to Moses’s death, indicates that Moses died only due to the fact that death was decreed upon all people following the sin of Adam.) "
31,14,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 32:44:1,"הוא והושע בן נון, for G’d commanded both of them, as we read in Deut. 31,14 והתייצבו באוהל מועד ואצונו, ”and stand at attention (plural mode) in the Tent of Testimony, and I will command, etc.”"
31,14,Commentary,Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"Look! Your time is approaching to die. Just as the moon only shines when the sun is about to set, similarly, Yehoshua was unable able to shine while Moshe’s light was still shining strongly… Once Moshe’s light began to set, Yehoshua’s light began to shine. This is what the verse means, “Your time is approaching to die,” and therefore it is the right time for you to place your spirit onto Yehoshua."
31,14,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Moed Katan 3:14","Our Rabbis were taught: One who dies suddenly, he is said to have died an abrupt death; if the death was preceded by one day's sickness, it is a hastened death. R. Chanina b. Gamaliel, however, says: ""The latter case is termed a plague-death, as it is said (Ez. 24, 16) Son of man, behold, I will take away from thee the desire of thy eyes by a sudden death (plague); and it is written again (Ib. 18) And when I had spoken unto the people in the morning, my wife died in the evening."" When one has been sick for two days and dies, it is considered a hurried death; after three days, it is considered a rebuked death; after four days, it is a frowned death; but if one dies after having been sick five days, it is considered an ordinary death. Said R. Chanin: ""What is the Biblical passage to prove this? (Deut. 31, 14) And God said unto Moses, Hehn Karbu yamecha lamuth (Behold, thy days approach that thou must die). Hehn means one in Greek; karbu (in the plural) is two; yamecha (in the plural) is also two, which make a total of five."" Death at the age of fifty is Kareth; at fifty-two, is the age at which Samuel of Ramah died; at sixty, an ordinary death. Said Mar Zutra: ""Whence is this deduced? (Job 5, 26) Thou wilt go in a ripe age, unto the grave; the word Bakelach (ripe age) equals the number sixty."" Seventy is called an old age; eighty, an age of uncommon vigor, as it is written (Ps. 90, 10) Our days are seventy years, and if by uncommon vigor they be eighty. Rabba, however, said: ""From fifty to sixty it is Kareth; and the reason why this is not stated in the Baraitha is because of the honor of Samuel."" When R. Joseph arrived at the age of sixty, he gave an entertainment to the Rabbis, for he said: ""I have passed the years of Kareth."" Said Abaye to him: ""It is true that the master has passed the years of Kareth, but has then the master already passed the days of Kareth?"" Whereupon R. Joseph answered him: ""Be content with one half in your hand."" R. Huna died suddenly, which caused the Rabbis great worry. A couple of sages of Hadaeb taught them: ""It was stated [regarding a sudden death] that only when the deceased has not reached the age of eighty; but if he has, it is, on the contrary, considered a death caused by a kiss."" "
31,14,Jewish Thought,"HaEmunot veHaDeot, [Treatise VI] The Soul and Death 6:1","And afterwards, I will speak about the end of the days of [a person's] life: And I say that the Creator of [the body and the soul] placed a measure of specific days to their combination. This is like (Exodus 23:26), ""I will fill the count of your days."" And He said to some prophets (Deuteronomy 31:14), ""Here, your days are drawing near to die""; and to others (II Samuel 7:12), ""When your days are filled,"" and that which is similar to this. And afterwards I say that there are times when He adds to this measure, knowing that the soul will remain [longer] with the body - given that his knowledge is no different than the truth about something. However this measure, for me, which absorbs the increase or reduction [in years] is the measure of strength that He gave to the body. And that is that - from the beginning, when He created him - there is no doubt that He built him with a specific strength, be it great or little. And the measure of the endurance of this strength is what is called the end (ketz). But He is able to add to him and strengthen him - such that with the seventy [years, on average,] He can establish thirty [more] years - and He is [also] able to weaken him and make him wilt, so that he wilts (dies) at forty. And according to this explanation, we can understand the addition to the end of the days [of a person], and the shortening of the life that there would be for a person; beyond the increase or reduction that His Creator knew [his natural strength] would bear in truth (naturally). And the explanation of this is that He knows that the root strength of the body (on average) is seventy years, and he may [then] add thirty years to it, or subtract thirty. And what is the source that obligates this reduction [or increase in years]? It is its statement (Proverbs 10:27), ""The fear of the Lord adds days."" And it [also] stated about some of the righteous ones (II Kings 20:6), ""And I will add fifteen years to your days."" And it states about many rewards, ""in order that your days will be lengthened,"" and that which is similar to it. And with the wicked, it stated (Exodus 12:29), ""and the Lord smote every firstborn in the Land of Egypt""; ""And those that died in the plague were"" (Numbers 25:9), and that which is similar to it. And if they died according to the strength of their [natural] end, the plague would not have been on account of their sin, nor would the plague have been stopped on account of Pinchas' deed . And the prophet already distinguished the plague from the end of [a person's days], when he said (I Samuel 26:10), ""the Lord will strike him with a plague, or his day will come and he will die."" But I am not saying that they add to the life of every righteous person, or that they subtract from every wicked person. Rather it is according to the choice of the Creator and according to the good [done by the person]. And [for] the righteous ones whose lives were not increased, the reward of the world to come is before him. And [for] the wicked ones whose lives were not shortened, the punishment of the world to come is before him. It is as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 3:1), ""and there is a time for everything,"""
31,14,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:14:1","ואצונו, “and I shall instruct him.” Rashi under-stands the word as “I will urge him to act promptly.” Nachmanides writes that there is no need to change the meaning of the word from what it means ordinarily, seeing that when G’d told Joshua ”you will bring,“ this is by itself a commandment. (Numbers 27,19) If Joshua had been deliberately slow in carrying out that command he would have been guilty of a capital offence. It is possible that the word ואצונו means: “I will inaugurate him as the leader of the Jewish nation.” 
"
31,14,Talmud,Moed Katan 28a:7,"Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the verse from which this is derived? It is stated: “Behold, your days approach that you must die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). This verse is expounded in the following manner: “Behold [hen]” indicates one; “approach [karvu],” a plural term, indicates two; “your days [yamekha],” also a plural term, indicates another two; and therefore in total this is five. How does the word hen indicate one? Because in the Greek language they call the number one hen."
31,14,Talmud,Sotah 13b:19,"The verse discussing when Joshua was appointed to be the successor of Moses states: “And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting” (Deuteronomy 31:14). A Sage taught: That Sabbath when Moses died was a day of two pairs [deyo zugei], i.e., two wise men, Moses and Joshua, serving together in one place. Authority was taken from one and given to the other."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Bereshit 8:3","The rabbis said: Slander is considered so grievous a sin that death was imposed upon Adam because of it. The serpent appeared and told Adam and Eve: “God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open,and ye shall be as God (Gen. 3:5). It was the fruit of this very tree that He ate when He created this world. Now, every craftsman hates a rival craftsman, but if you should eat of this tree, you too shall become divine.” (Cf. Midrash on Psalms 1:9, Bereshit Rabbah 19:4.)  They listened to him and thus brought death upon themselves and their descendants unto the end of all generations. Whence do we know this? We know it from the words Behold man (Gen. 3:22). The word Behold alludes only to death, as it is written: Behold, thy days approach that thou must die (Deut. 31:14)."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vayechi 2:8","Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years, while Moses lived only one hundred and twenty. Hence it is written about him: Behold, thy days draw near that thou must die (Deut. 31:24). And drew near is written with reference to Jacob, and he did not attain the age of his forebears. Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years, and Isaac lived one hundred and eighty years, while Jacob lived only one hundred and forty-seven years. Hence drew near is written concerning him: And the days of Israel drew near that he should die."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, V'Zot HaBerachah 6:1","(Deut. 31:14:) “Then the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Behold the days are drawing near for you to die.” (This verse indicates that this paragraph and the two that follow properly belong to the third section of the missing midrash later on.)  This text is related (to Prov. 11:31), “Behold, shall a righteous one be recompensed on earth?” (The sense of the midrash requires these words to be read as a question.)  With reference to whom is this text spoken? It speaks of none other than Moses the righteous, for there is no one like him, not among the prophets and not among the sages. So here is the Holy One, blessed be He, testifying concerning him after his death (in Deut. 34:10), “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.” Still, he did not have the power to save himself from death, all the more so other people. And David therefore said (in I Chron. 29:15), “For we are sojourners before You and transients like all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.” But is it not written (in Ps. 37:34), “Hope in the Lord and keep His way, [and He will raise you up to inherit the land?” So why does the text say (in I Chron. 29:15), “and there is no hope?” David said, “Master of the world, in all circumstances a person has hope. If one is poor, he hopes until he becomes rich. If he is feeble, he hopes until be becomes strong. [If] he is sick, he hopes until he is healed. If he is confined in prison, he hopes until they free him. On the day of death, however, he has no hope.” As see here that the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke with Moses face to face, but he was [still] not able to save himself from death. And so Solomon has said (in Eccl. 9:2), “Since everything [happens] to everyone, [the same lot to the righteous and to the wicked]. (Cf. PRK 26:1.)  R. Hanina said, “In the case of an intercessory spirit, (Pisqonit. Cf. Sanh. 44b, where the Tosafot and the notes of Elijah Gaon of Vilna, citing Rashi, identify this spirit with Gabriel, who was surnamed Pisqon, because he argues against the Holy One.)  it has authority to speak before the Holy One, blessed be He. [Such a one is] like a senator (Lat.: senator.)  before the king. So he says to [the Holy One, blessed be He], ‘Master of the world, all flesh is [destined] for death. Abraham experienced death, Nimrod experienced death; Isaac experienced death, Abimelech experienced death; Moses experienced death, Pharaoh experienced death; for Solomon has stated (in Eccl. 3:20), “Everyone is going to the same place.” So from now on, what gain is there for the righteous to be engaged with the Torah and good works in this world? And what loss is there for the wicked to sin and cause [others] to sin in this world?’ Solomon has the explanation (in vs. 21), ‘Who knows the lifebreath (spirit) of humans (literally, the Children of Adam) that rise upward [and the lifebreath (spirit) of the beast that goes down into the earth]?’ ‘The spirit of humans,’ these are the spirits of the righteous, because they are put in storage and hidden under the throne of glory; (Shab. 152b; Deut. R. 11:10.)  ‘and the spirit of the beast that goes down into the earth,’ these are the spirits of the wicked, which go down to Gehinnom. And so it says (in Is. 14:15), ‘You shall also be brought down unto Sheol, [unto the uttermost parts of the pit].’” But where is it shown that the righteous are called Adam? Where Jonah says so (in Jon. 4:11), “So should I not take pity on Nineveh, [that great city] in which there are over a hundred and twenty thousand persons (literally, Adams), [who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals].” “Adams,” these are the righteous; “who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals,” these are the wicked, in that their actions are like the actions of the animals. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 11:31), “Behold, shall a righteous one be recompensed on earth?”"
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, V'Zot HaBerachah 7:1","(Deut. 31:14:) “Behold (hn) the days are drawing near for you [to die].” Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, with the word that I [used to] praise (Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  You when I said (in Deut. 10:14), ‘Behold (hn) the heavens [and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it] belong to the Lord your God’; by that [very word] (i.e., hn) you have condemned me to death?” (Above, Deut. 2:6.)  The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I am bringing you peace of mind, (as in Deut. 31:16), ‘Behold (hn-) you (-k) are [soon] to sleep with your ancestors….’” R. Abbahu said, “The words, behold you (hnk), can only mean peace of mind, since it is stated (in Job 3:17), ‘there (in death) the weary are at rest (yanuhu, understood to have the root hnk).’” (Cf. Gen. R. 9:5.)  (Deut. 31:14, literally:) “Behold your days are drawing near [to die].” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “A drawing near is uttered with reference to the forefathers, and a drawing near is uttered with reference to the kings (in I Kings 2:1), ‘Then when the days for David to die drew near.’ With reference to the prophets (there is Moses, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, addresses in the second person in Deut. 31:14), ‘Behold your days are drawing near [to die].’” R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10), ‘In whose hand is every living soul.’ If the living are delivered into His hand, are the dead not delivered into His hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living. (Ber. 18ab.)  Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20), ‘And Benaiah ben Jehoiada, the son of a valiant warrior (literally, of a living person) from Kazbeel, [who had performed great deeds…].’ And is not everyone [eventually] dead? However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30), ‘And you, O slain wicked [prince of Israel, whose day has come…].’” And so it says (in Deut. 17:6), “On the evidence of two or three witnesses shall the dead be put to death.” Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. Because on seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, ""blessed be the One who forms light."" (The opening blessing before the morning Shema‘.)  When it sets, he does not say the blessing, ""who brings on evenings."" (The opening blessing before the evening Shema‘.)  Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every thing that they eat and drink, and see and hear. Moreover, [these blessings] are uttered not only while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5-6), “Let the saints rejoice in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds. With paeans to God in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands.”"
31,14,Midrash,Kohelet Rabbah 3:2:3,"Another matter, “a time to be born” – from the time to be born, it is the time to die. From the moment that a person is born, it is decreed upon him how many years he will live. If he merits, he will complete his years. If not, his life will be shortened, as it is written: “The fear of the Lord will increase days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened” (Proverbs 10:27). This is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. The Rabbis say: If he merits, his life will be extended; if not, his life will be shortened. If he merits, his life will be extended, as it is stated: “Behold, I will add fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5). He said to them: From his own it is added to him. (If one had his original life expectancy shortened, it will be restored. Thus, regarding the verse cited from Isaiah, the fifteen years restored Hezekiah to his original life expectancy.)  Know [that this is so,] as it is written: “Behold, a son is born to the house of David, Josiah is his name…” (I Kings 13:2), and Menashe (The order of the succession of the monarchy was Hezekiah, Menashe, Amon, Josiah.)  had not yet entered the world. (The prophecy about Josiah had been delivered hundreds of years earlier. When Hezekiah was granted the additional fifteen years, Menashe, his son, had not yet been born. Clearly, from the outset, Hezekiah was always supposed to have lived long enough to beget Menashe, Josiah’s grandfather.)  They said to him: Is it written: A son will be born to the house of David from Hezekiah? That is not stated, but rather “to the house of David,” [and it could have been] a son from a different [branch] of the royal house of David. This supports what the Sages, our rabbis said: There was an incident involving one of the prominent men of Tzippori, who had occasion to circumcise [his son], and the residents of Ein Te’ena came up to honor him and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta came up with them. When they came to the city gates, they came across the sound of lads standing and playing before one courtyard. They saw Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta, who was distinguished and handsome. They said to him: ‘You will not move from here until you dance for us a bit.’ He said to them: ‘This is inappropriate for me, as I am an elderly man.’ He reprimanded them, but they were not daunted and did not submit. He lifted his glance and saw that the courtyard [was going to be] overturned. (Due to their impudence in insisting that Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta dance for them, the courtyard would be destroyed.)  He said to them: ‘Repeat after me what I say: Go and say to this owner of this courtyard: “If you are sleeping, awaken, as the beginning of sin is sweet but its end is bitter.”’ From the sound of their words the owner of that courtyard awakened, and he emerged, and fell at [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta’s] feet. He said: ‘Rabbi, I beg of you, do not pay attention to their words, as they are young and foolish.’ [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘What can we do for you, the edict has already been issued. (The courtyard will be destroyed.)  However, I will delay it for you [so you have enough] time to take out everything that you have in the courtyard.’ When he had taken out everything that he had in the courtyard, that courtyard was lifted up and then crashed down [and was destroyed]. They went to fulfill the mitzva of circumcision, and the father of the boy was giving them aged wine to drink, and saying: ‘Drink of this fine wine, as I trust in the Master of Heaven that I will [also] give you to drink of it at his wedding.’ They answered him: ‘Just as you brought him to circumcision, so may you bring him to Torah and to the wedding canopy.’ From the sound of their words, Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta emerged into the darkness, (He set out to return home even though it was night.)  he was accosted by the emissary of the people. (The angel of death.)  [The angel of death] said to him: ‘Is it because you rely on your good deeds that you are going out at a time that is not a time?’ (For people to be outside.)  [Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘You, who are you?’ He said to him: ‘I am the emissary of the people.’ He said to him: ‘Why do you look forlorn?’ He said: ‘It is from the sound of the harsh words that I hear from people every day.’ He said to him: ‘What are they?’ He said to him: ‘That baby that you circumcised today, I have the document of his [fate, which states] that I am to take him from here in thirty days. His father gave you to drink and said: “Drink this fine wine as I trust in the Master of Heaven that I will give you to drink of it at his wedding.” I heard and I was sad, because your prayer (The prayer the guests had said to the father: ‘Just as you brought him to circumcision, so may you bring him to Torah and to the wedding canopy.’)  abrogates it.’ [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘By your life, show me my fate.’ He said to him: ‘I have no control over yours and not over your colleagues.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ He said: ‘It is because each and every day you exert yourself in Torah and mitzvot and perform acts of righteousness, and the Holy One blessed be He adds years to your lifetimes.’ He said to him: ‘May it be the will of the Holy One blessed be He that just as you do not control our fates, so you will not have license to violate our words and our plea for mercy from Heaven.’ The baby lived. (This proves that, contrary to Rabbi Akiva’s statement, people can live beyond their predetermined life expectancy.)  Rabbi Akiva said: What is [the significance of] this incident for us? I do not have an incident, but rather a verse: “I will fill the number of your days” (Exodus 23:26). Moses, how many mitzvot did he fulfill and how many acts of righteousness, and ultimately, it was stated to him: “Behold, your days are approaching to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14); that is: “A time to be born [and a time to die].” Another matter, “a time to be born and a time to die” – when a man is born, the Holy One blessed be He waits up to twenty years for him to marry a woman. If he reached the age of twenty and did not marry a woman, the Holy One blessed be He says to him: It is “a time to be born” for you, (A time for you to have children.)  but you did not wish to do so; this is nothing other than “a time to die.” Some say: One waits only a bit before that which will burn him. (Since a man is liable to lose his life if he is not married by the age of twenty, he would do well not to wait until close to that age, and marry even before the age of twenty.)  “A time to plant,” in peacetime; “and a time to uproot that which is planted,” in wartime."
31,14,Midrash,Kohelet Rabbah 9:11:2,"Another matter, “that the race is not to the swift” – this is Moses; yesterday he flew to the sky and ascended like a bird, as it is stated: “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3), but today, “as you will not be crossing this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27); he was not allowed to cross even a tract of fifty cubits. “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Moses. Yesterday, “The kings of hosts flee again and again” (Psalms 68:13). What is “again and again”? They flee on the way there, and flee on the way back. (At the giving of the Torah, the angels flew back and forth in fear while Moses stood calmly on the mountain.)  Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: Ministering angels is not written here, but rather kings of hosts; even the kings of the angels, Mikhael and Gavriel, were afraid of Moses. Now, he is unable to look at even the weakest soldiers; that is what is written: “For I was terrified due to the wrath and the fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19). “Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Moses. Yesterday, he became a minister and an official in Pharaoh’s palace, as it is stated: “Moses was grown up, and he went out to his brethren” (Exodus 2:11). What is [the meaning of the statement that Moses] “was grown up”? It was that his greatness was to bring in and to take out. (He was in charge of providing food for Pharaoh’s household.)  But today, “call him and let him eat bread” (Exodus 2:20). “And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Moses. From where did the wealth come to him, such that he became wealthy? Rabbi Ḥanin said: The Holy One blessed be He revealed to him a sapphire quarry inside his tent and he found it. It is from there that Moses became wealthy, as it is stated: “Carve for yourself [pesol lekha]” (Exodus 34:1); its residue [pesilatan] shall be for you. But today, none of that wealth remains. “And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Moses. Yesterday, “as you have found favor in my eyes” (Exodus 33:17), and today, “do not continue to speak to Me anymore about this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26). “But rather, time and chance [vafega] befalls them all.” It is time that harms the person and undermines him in all these matters, and he is injured [mafgia]. What shall he do? He shall go and engage in prayer and supplication, and he will be saved. Rav Huna asked Shmuel, he said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “But rather time and chance [vafega]”?’ [Shmuel] said to him: ‘At times a person entreats in prayer and is answered, at times he entreats and is not answered, as you have no one who arranged prayers and supplications more than Moses our master, and ultimately it was stated to him: “Behold, your days to die are approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14).’ (Moses prayed many times, and intensely, that he be permitted to enter the land of Israel, yet he died without being allowed to do so.) "
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayechi 4:3","Our masters have said: Everyone about whom a drawing near was stated never attained the age of his ancestors. It is written (in I Kings 2:1): THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR; so he did not attain the age of his ancestors Boaz, Obed, and Jesse. Our masters have said: They lived more than four hundred years < in all > ; David only lived seventy years. He did not reach the age of his ancestors; therefore, a drawing near was written about him. Amram was alive a hundred and thirty {-three} [-seven] years, but Moses (his son) only lived to a hundred and twenty. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD, THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE. And in the case of Jacob, a drawing near is written about him because he did not attain the age of his ancestors. Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years; Isaac, a hundred and eighty; but Jacob, a hundred and forty-seven. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Gen. 47:29): THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vaetchanan 6:2","(Job 20:6): EVEN THOUGH ONE'S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS. This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and whose feet trod on Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from his hand. When his time to die arrived, he said to him (in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE.  said to him: Sovereign of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before your children like a horse? Is my end the worm and the maggot? R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said: This is suitable only for the king. What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift. (Gk.: doron.)  The king said: Cut off his head with it. So also Moses said to the Holy One: By the word that I  praise (Rt.: KLS. Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  you, when I said (in Deut. 10:14): BEHOLD (hen),  BELONG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD! by that  word (i.e., hen) you are decreeing death over me, when you say (in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD (hen), THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU . (Below, Deut. 11:6.)  He said to him: I have already decreed (Rt.: QLS. Cf. Lat.: census; Gk.: kensos.)  death over the first Adam. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, [the first] Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. But I should not die. He said to him: Consider Abraham, who sanctified my name in the world but  died. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, consider  out of him there came Ishmael, whose race provoked you to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY, THE ONES WHOM GOD BROUGHT FORTH IN HIS HAND. He said to him: consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar. He said to him: Out of him there came Esau the Wicked, who destroyed your sanctuary and burned your temple. He said to him: Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes. He said to him Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he did not receive Torah from your hand, and he did not speak with you face to face. The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 3:26): ENOUGH FROM YOU! DO NOT  SPEAK  AGAIN. He said to him: Perhaps  generations will say: If he had not found evil things in Moses, he would not have removed him from the world. He said to him: I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10): NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, perhaps [the people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age. He said to him: I have already written (in Deut. 32:51): [BECAUSE YOU ACTED FAITHLESSLY WITH ME] , BECAUSE YOU DID NOT SANCTIFY ME . (Cf. Numb. 20:12.)  He said to him: If you are willing, let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years [there], and after that let me die. He said to him: It is an irrevocable decision from me. He said to him: If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death. He said to him: Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, why all this anger against me? (According to Deut. 32:51) BECAUSE HE DID NOT SANCTIFY ME. He said to him: With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29): BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A MAN; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me. The Holy One said to him: See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. (1) In the first place you said (in Exod. 4:13) PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT. (2, in Exod. 5:23:) FOR EVER SINCE I CAME TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME, [HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE, AND YOU HAVE STILL NOT DELIVERED YOUR PEOPLE]. (3, In Numb. 16:29:) THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME. (4, In Numb. 16:30:) BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW. (5, In Numb. 20:10:) LISTEN, YOU REBELS, ? (See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.)  (6, Numb:32:14:) AND NOW YOU BROOD OF SINNERS HAVE ARISEN IN PLACE OF YOUR ANCESTORS. But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children? He said to him: I have learned so from you, when you said (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): THE CENSERS OF  WHO HAVE SINNED . He said to him: I said (ibid.): AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES, and not: ""At the cost of their ancestors."" He said to him: Sovereign of the World: I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before you a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, you forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads because of me, yet you are not taking care of me. He said to him: Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now time was delivered into your hands, but now time is not delivered into your hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which you have brought on my body. So do not deliver me into the bonds of the angel of death. Moreover, if you do this, I will proclaim your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17–18): I SHALL NOT DIE, BUT LIVE AND RECOUNT THE WORKS OF THE LORD.  He said to him (in vs. 20): THIS IS THE GATE OF THE LORD; [THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL COME THROUGH IT.] From this it follows that for the righteous and for all mortals death has been ordained from time immemorial. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to heaven and earth, where he said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6): FOR THE HEAVENS SHALL VANISH LIKE SMOKE, AND THE EARTH SHALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT. (See ‘AZ a for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.)  He went to the sun and the moon. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 24:23): THEN THE MOON SHALL BE ASHAMED, AND THE SUN SHALL BE ABASHED. He went to the stars and planets. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: [Instead of us seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, [since it is stated] (in Is. 34:4): ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN SHALL ROT AWAY [….] He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: We should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10): FOR THE MOUNTAINS SHALL MOVE, AND THE HILLS SHALL BE SHAKEN. (The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical versions but fits the sense of the midrash.)  He went to the Great Sea. He said to it: [Seek mercy for me. The sea] said to him: Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of  days? Are you not the son of Amram?  who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12): WHO HAD  WALK AT THE RIGHT HAND OF MOSES, …. So now what has happened to you? When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2): O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, ! When I stood by you, I was a king in the world; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me. Immediately he betook himself to the Arch of the  Presence and said to him: Seek mercy for me, that I not die. He said to him: My Master, Moses, why is this a problem? This is what I have heard from behind the Curtain: (Pargod. Cf. Lat.: paragauda or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: Paragaudes (a garment with a purple border).)  that your prayer has not been heard on this matter. Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said: With whom shall I seek mercy for myself? R. Simlay said: At that time the Holy One was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26): BUT THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME, until Moses began by uttering this scripture: (Exod. 34:6:) [THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE HIM AND PROCLAIMED:] THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, …. Immediately the Holy Spirit cooled him off. The Holy One said to Moses: Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, are you coming to me with a plot? You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from your hand lick the dust? Woe (Vay.)  to all mortals. They will say: If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with him face to face, and received Torah from his hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, how much the worse it will be for  flesh and blood, who comes with no Torah and with no commandments? The Holy One said to Moses: Why all this sorrow over which you are sorrowing? He said: Sovereign of the World, I am afraid of the bonds of the angel of death. He said to him: I am not delivering you into his hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, my mother [Jochebed], who was put to shame (literally: whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be put to shame by my death. He said to him: This has come to mind, but this is the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators, (Gk.: pronoi (“prudent ones”).)  every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve , [but now the lot of your disciple Joshua has arrived for him to serve ]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple! He said to him: If you want to do that, go and do it. Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door. (Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.)  Now Joshua was seated expounding , so Moses stopped to bend his proud stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself [to death]. When Israel came to Moses' door, they found him at the door of Joshua with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua: What has come over you that Moses our Master stands, while you sit? When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said: O my Master, my Master! My Father, my Father and Lord! Israel said to Moses: Moses our Master, teach us Torah. He said to them: I have no authority. They said to him: We are not leaving you. A heavenly voice (bat qol) came forth and said to them: Learn from Joshua. They took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with Eleazar and Ithamar to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Johanan said: When Joshua opened by saying: Blessed be the one who has chosen the righteous and their Mishnaic teaching, they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose , they said to Moses: Close off the Torah for us. He said to them: I do not know what to answer you. So Moses our Master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said: Sovereign of the World, up to now I wanted to live, but now here is my soul given over to you.. Then when he had resigned his soul to death, the Holy One opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16): WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS? Who will stand for Israel in the time of my wrath? Who will stand in the battle of my children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before me? At that time Metatron (Lat.: metator (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).)  came and fell on his face. He said to him: Sovereign of the World,  in Moses' life he belonged to you, so in his death he belongs to you. The Holy One said to him: Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day his father was angry with him and sought to kill him, because he did not maintain respect for his father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. Her servants said to him: Our Lord King, why are you weeping? He said to them: It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, she rescued him from my hand. So also did the Holy One say to Metatron: It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before me [to turn back my anger from destroying them]. They came and said to Moses: The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said to them: Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them. He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said: The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world. He said to Israel: I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me. They said to him: Our Lord Master, you are forgiven. Israel also arose before him and said to him: O Moses our Master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us. He said to them: You are forgiven. They came and said to him: The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said: Blessed be the name of the one who lives and abides forever. He said to Israel: If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones. They said: Woe (oy) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness. They came and said to him: The half moment has arrived. He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel: See the final end of flesh and blood. My two hands with which I received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall in the grave. At that moment his breath departed with a kiss (from the Holy One), (See MQ 28a.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5): THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE . (BB 17a; ARN, A 12:2; Cant. R. 1:2:5; Petirat Mosheh Rabbenu, recension A, in A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853-57), vol. I, p. 129; ibid., recension B, in Jellinek, vol. VI, p. 77.)  Now  took care of his burial were neither Israel nor any of the angels but the Holy One , as stated (in vs. 6): THEN HE (THE HOLY ONE) BURIED HIM (MOSES) IN THE VALLEY …. And for what reason was he buried outside the land? So that those who die when outside the land might live again through his merit, (The translation here follows the traditional Tanhuma. Deut. 2:6. So also Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34. The Buber text omits “might live again” and reads “through their merit.”)  as stated (in Deut. 33:21): HE HAS CHOSEN THE BEST FOR HIMSELF, . But when did Moses our Master die? On the seventh of Adar, (Seder ‘Olam Rabbah, 10; TSot. 11:7; Qid. 38a; see Meg. 13b; Sot. 12b.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5): THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE …. It is also written (in vs. 8): AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MOURNED MOSES ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB FOR THIRTY DAYS. And it is written (in Josh. 1:1–2): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF MOSES, THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, : MOSES MY SERVANT IS DEAD. (Josh. 4:19:) NOW THE PEOPLE CAME UP FROM THE JORDAN ON THE TENTH DAY OF {THIS} [THE FIRST] MONTH (i.e., Nisan). Reckon back from those thirty-three days. Ergo, he died on the seventh of Adar. And where is it shown that he was born on the seventh of Adar? Where it is stated (in Deut. 31:2): HE SAID TO THEM: I AM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS OLD TODAY. (Since Moses spoke these words on the day of his death, his birthday must have been the same as the day of his death.)  What is the significance of TODAY?  to teach you that the Holy One fulfills the years for the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as stated (in Exod. 23:26): I WILL FULFILL THE NUMBER OF YOUR DAYS."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, V'Zot HaBerachah 5:1","(Deut. 31:14:) THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE. (This verse indicates that this paragraph and the two that follow properly belong to the third section of the missing midrash on Parashah IX.) : This text is related (to Prov. 11:31): BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH? (Tanh., Deut. 11:6. The sense of the midrash requires these words to be read as a question.)  With reference to whom is this text spoken? It speaks of none other than Moses the Righteous, for there is no one like him, not among the prophets and not among the sages. So here is the Holy One testifying concerning him after his death (in Deut. 34:10): NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES ; still, he did not have the power to save himself from death. David therefore said (in I Chron. 29:15): FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS; OUR DAYS ON THE EARTH ARE LIKE A SHADOW, AND THERE IS NO HOPE. But is it not written (in Ps. 37:34): HOPE IN THE LORD AND KEEP HIS WAY, AND HE WILL RAISE YOU UP TO INHERIT THE LAND? So why does the text say (in I Chron. 29:15): AND THERE IS NO HOPE? David said: Sovereign of the Universe, in all circumstances a person has hope. If one is poor,  until he becomes rich.  feeble,  until be becomes strong. If he is sick,  until he is healed. If he is confined in prison,  until they free him. On the day of death, however, he has no hope. So here the Holy One spoke with Moses face to face, but he was not able to save himself from death. And so Solomon has said (in Eccl. 9:2): SINCE EVERYTHING  TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT  TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED. (Cf. PRK 26:1.) : R. Hanina said: In the case of an intercessory spirit, (Pisqonit. Cf. Sanh. 44b, where the Tosafot and the notes of Elijah Gaon of Vilna, citing Rashi, identify this spirit with Gabriel, who was surnamed Pisqon, because he argues against the Holy One.)  it has authority to speak before the Holy One.  like a senator (Lat.: senator.)  before the King. So he says to : Sovereign of the Universe, all flesh is  for death. Abraham experienced death; the wicked Nimrod experienced death; Isaac experienced death; Abimelech experienced death; Moses experienced death; the wicked Pharaoh experienced death; for Solomon has stated (in Eccl. 3:20): EVERYONE IS GOING TO THE SAME PLACE. So from now on, what gain is there for the righteous to be engaged with the Torah and good works in this world? And what loss is there for the wicked to sin and cause  to sin in this world? Solomon has the explanation (in vs. 21): WHO KNOWS THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS THAT ? THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS: These are the spirits of the righteous, because they are put in storage and hidden under the Throne of Glory. (Shab. 152b; Deut. R. 11:10; cf. Revelation 6:9, where the souls of the martyrs are under the heavenly altar.)  AND THE LIFEBREATH OF THE BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH: These are the spirits of the wicked, which go down to Gehinnom. And so it says (in Is. 14:15): YOU SHALL ALSO {GO DOWN} [BE BROUGHT DOWN] UNTO SHEOL, . But where is it shown that the righteous are called ADAM? Where Jonah says so (in Jonah 4:11): SO SHOULD I NOT TAKE PITY ON NINEVEH,  IN WHICH THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PERSONS (literally: ADAMS), AND  ANIMALS. ADAMS: These are the righteous; AND  ANIMALS: These are the wicked, in that their works are like the work of the wicked. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 11:31): BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH?"
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, V'Zot HaBerachah 6:1","[(Deut. 31:14:) BEHOLD (HN) THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU . Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, with the word that I  praise (Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  you when I said (in Deut. 10:14): BEHOLD (HN) THE HEAVENS  BELONG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD! By that  (i.e., HN) you have condemned me at death. (Above, Deut. 2:6; Tanh., Deut. 11:7.) : The Holy One said to him: I am bringing about contentment, (as in Deut. 31:16): BEHOLD (HN-) YOU (-K) ARE  TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS…. R. Abbahu said: The words, BEHOLD YOU (HNK), can only mean contentment, since it is stated (in Job 3:17): THERE (in death) THE WEARY ARE AT REST (yanuhu, understood to have the root HNK). (Cf. Gen. R. 9:5.) "
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, V'Zot HaBerachah 7:1","(Deut. 31:14, literally:) BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR . R. Joshua ben Levi said: A drawing near is uttered with reference to the ancestors, and a drawing near is uttered with reference to the kings (in I Kings 2:1): THEN WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR. With reference to the prophets (there is Moses, whom the Holy One addresses in the second person in Deut. 31:14): BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR . Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10): IN WHOSE HAND IS EVERY LIVING SOUL. If the living are delivered into his hand, are the dead not delivered into his hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living. (Ber. 18ab.)  Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20): AND BENAIAH BEN JEHOIADA, THE SON OF A VALIANT WARRIOR (literally: OF A LIVING PERSON) FROM KAZBEEL, WHO HAD PERFORMED GREAT DEEDS…. However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30 [25]): AND YOU, O SLAIN WICKED < PRINCE OF ISRAEL, WHOSE DAY HAS COME>…. And so it says (in Deut. 17:6): ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES SHALL THE DEAD BE PUT TO DEATH. Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. For what reason? On seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, ""Blessed Be the One Who Forms the Luminaries."" (The words, “Blessed are you, O Lord, who forms the luminaries (Barukh yotser ha-me’orot),” come at the end of the first blessing before the morning Shema‘, Yotser Or (“Who Forms Light”). For its use as a separate blessing with the title given here, see Ber. 12a. Note that the parallel in Tanh., Deut. 11:7, has the ore traditional Yotser Or here.)  When it sets, he does not say the blessing, ""Who Brings on Evenings."" (The opening blessing before the evening Shema‘.) : Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every  things. Moreover, they are uttered, not  while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5): LET THE SAINTS REJOICE IN GLORY; LET THEM SING FOR JOY UPON THEIR BEDS…."
31,14,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:14:1","הן קרבו ימיך למות, “here your days to die are drawing near.” According to the plain meaning of the text this verse teaches that the period man has to live has been predetermined, every single human being having a time allocated to him at birth. G’d sees to it that every person lives out the time thus allocated to him at birth. This would correspond to Exodus 23,26: “I will ensure that you complete the number of your days (years).” The expression קריבה, “approach,” mentioned here is one which is specifically reserved for the approach of death of righteous people as we know already from Genesis 47,29 when the Torah speaks about the approaching death of Israel our patriarch. Similarly, Kings I 2,1: “the time for David to die approached.” These verses prove that such times had been determined by G’d already at birth, and that G’d’s השגחה, “benevolent supervision of history,” ensures that the individuals in question get to live out their allotted time, that their lives are not cut short by acts of violence or natural disasters. Alternatively, G’d lengthens the allotted life span of these people as a reward for merits which they have accumulated during their lives. At the same time, their allotted life span may be reduced due to demerits they have become guilty of. The important thing is that no one dies unless G’d has so determined.  According to our information that G’d has empowered planetary forces, stars and their constellations, to exercise their influence on the lives of people on terrestrial earth, and the orbits of these forces are of constructive or destructive influence on these lives so that their lives appear to depend on mazal,” i.e. such influences (Targum Kohelet 9,2), we find that our sages did not deny the impact of such mazal; we therefore seem to be faced with a dilemma here. Our sages said specifically that phenomena such as economic success, (duration of) life on earth itself, as well as the ability to have children, do not depend on one’s merit but on one’s mazal (Moed Katan 28). If that is so, where is there room for G’d’s השגחה in the matter? Further details of our sages’ view is found in their statement that though both Rabbah and Rav Chisdah were righteous individuals (seeing that when they prayed for rain it materialised), one lived only to the age of 40 whereas the other lived to the age of 92. Rabbah’s 40 years on earth were filled with painful experiences. Rav Chisdah was blessed to marry off 60 children, whereas Rabbah buried 60 family members. The latter could not always afford to eat even bread made from barley, whereas the former fed his dogs with white bread. These statements are proof positive that the sages acknowledged the influence of mazal in our lives, i.e. that there is substance to the discipline we call astrology.  It is true that these planetary phenomena have been equipped with initial power to influence our fates. However, they are not supreme. Their influence need not be final. They are subservient to the Lord Almighty, to the attribute Hashem. If people born under adverse mazal turn to the supreme G’d, to Hashem, and appeal to Him to neutralize their apparently negative mazal, G’d will respond to such prayer if it is warranted. In fact, we may go further and posit that G’d instituted mazal partly in order to encourage us to pray to Him to change adverse mazal in His benevolent way. We know that G’d can lengthen our lives from the very verse in Exodus 23,26: “I will make full the number of your days,” i.e. “I will add to them if the situation warrants.”  King Chizkiyah had 15 years added to his life expectancy although the prophet Isaiah had been sent to him to prepare his last will and testament as he was not going to recover from his sickness. G’d responded to his prayer and revoked the decree he had been subject to (Isaiah 38,5). We also know that when the occasion warrants it G’d reduces the number of years allocated to a person at birth, from Achazyah King of Israel son of Achav. The reason he had his life span shortened was that when he fell ill, instead of turning to G’d or to an accredited prophet, he turned to idols to inquire about his chances of a recovery (compare Kings II 1,16). He was told clearly that he would die now because he had turned to Baal Zevuv, the god of Akron, ignoring the presence of accredited prophets in Israel. The verse we just quoted makes it plain that Achazya’s death at that time was due to his having turned to idols at that time. Had death already have been decreed upon him previously, what point was there in the prophet telling him about it now? The above examples teach us that G’d reserves the right to lengthen or shorten the life span decreed for man at birth. G’d remains a free agent; this is why He is known as שדי. The word, derived from שדד, means that He is in charge of the laws of nature, changing them at will if He so desires. (Compare author’s comments on Genesis 17,1) These adjustments in life span, etc., occur with a view to reward and punishment. It follows that the statement that “life (expectancy), children (ability to have them), and economic success, do not depend on merit but on mazal,” which we quoted from Moed Katan, means that the power of prayer is so great that it can override predetermined fates set according to mazal. The astrologers themselves admit that the general rules are set by G’d, whereas the planetary systems only supplement details pertaining to the lives of the subjects under their influence. Clearly, He who sets the general rules is able to set aside mere details, i.e. the subordinate powers assigned to the horoscopes. It follows that it is within man’s power to create the conditions for setting aside such details if his actions merit it and he appeals to the Lord to use His powers on his behalf. On occasion, G’d fulfills man’s desire without waiting for man to appeal to Him. What the statement in Moed Katan, regarding the three cardinal parts of man’s fate does mean is that in these matters G’d does not interfere with the predetermined fates of these individuals unless asked, unless appealed to. This is the meaning of Psalms 145,19 ואת שועתם ישמע ויושיעים, “and their cry He hears and He delivers them.” On the other hand, the same psalmist says in the first half of this verse: “He does the will of those who fear Him;” this refers to the unspoken requests by these people. We have proof positive from the Torah and the Books of Prophets that the three critical values of man, 1) children, 2) life, and 3) economic success, פרנסה, are all subject to prayer. Rachel, who had been unable to conceive and had prayed was granted children (Genesis 30,22): “G’d listened to her and opened her womb.” King Chizkiyah provided proof for the fact that G’d changes even decrees of death announced by one of His prophets at His command. Elijah and Elisha both experienced that the supply of food was dramatically increased through their prayerful intervention in the fates of starving individuals (Kings I 17,13-15 and Kings II 5,42-44). These individuals were saved from famine, although clearly that had been their assigned fate.  This is the reason why our sages singled out these three aspects of life which are normally dependent on mazal to inform us that even these matters are subject to change by means of prayer by the intended victims."
31,14,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:14:2","A Midrashic approach (based on Devarim Rabbah 9,4). The words: “here the days of your death are approaching,” reflect a conversation between Moses and G’d. Moses had said to G’d: ”I have praised You using the word הן (Deut. 10,14), and You are using the same word introducing the decree that I am to die.”  We may understand this by means of a parable. A king had an outstanding minister, one of whom he was exceedingly fond. One day this minister came across a sword, which was exceptionally beautiful, the like of which he had never seen. He immediately determined that this sword was appropriate for his employer, the king. What did he do? He bought it and presented it to the king as a gift. The king said: “may they cut off his head with it.” This is what Moses had in mind when he said to G’d: “are You going to use my gift to turn it against me?”  Another thought which is contained in the words הן קרבו ימיך למות, is that G’d meant: “the time has come for your sun to set and for the moon to shine.” This was a reference to the statement of our sages we have already quoted in which the face of Moses was compared to that of the sun whereas that of Joshua, his successor, was compared to that of the moon. When G’d said to Moses: “here you are going to lie with your ancestors, and this nation will arise and serve idols, etc.,” (verse 16 in our chapter), He meant that “your power, that of the exceptional level of prophecy granted to you, will continue to illuminate the moon (inspire Joshua) although you are already in your grave, just as the sun even after it has set shines upon the surface of the moon to enable it to reflect its light.” The word וקם may be read together with the words הנך שוכב עם אבותיך וקם, “although you are lying with your fathers it will rise.” Just as the sun supplies light to the moon even after it has set, you Moses will inspire Joshua even after you have joined your fathers. This is also the meaning of the word ואצונו, i.e. “I will impress My power on the moon.”"

(Ibid. 2): ""And the L-rd said to him: 'What is this in your hand?' And he said: 'A staff.'"" Why did G-d hold this against Moses? Should he not have questioned as he did? I heard from the Gaon, R. Eliyahu Schick, of blessed memory, that He took exception to the words ""But 'Hen' they will not believe me,"" stated categorically. He should have said ""Perhaps they will not believe me."" [This explains what our sages of blessed memory said: ""When the Holy One Blessed be He said to Moses (Devarim 31:14): ""Hen your days have drawn near to die,"" Moses replied: ""With 'Hen' did I praise You (viz. Ibid. 10:14): ""Hen, to the L-rd your G-d are the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, etc."") and with 'Hen' do You answer me?"" The L-red replied: ""But you also said: 'But Hen they will not believe me.'"" Ostensibly, this is unexplainable; but, according to the above interpretation, the meaning is clear: The Holy One Blessed be He said to him: ""'Hen' your days have drawn near to die"" — categorically. This was very difficult for Moses to accept, and he answered: ""But I praised You with 'Hen,"" and do You answer me with 'Hen'!"" And to this the L-rd replied, that this is ""measure for measure"" for his also having said 'Hen' [categorically]."
31,14,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:14:1","I shall enthuse them. For one cannot say it means literally a command, as there is no command written afterwards. "
31,14,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:14:2,"Another intention of the Torah for using the expression הן קרבו, may be as follows: ""The days which are yours have approached; these days are the ones on which parts of your soul are approaching."" This is the mystical dimension of Psalms 104,29: תוסף רוחם יגועון, ""when You take away their breath they will perish."" In my commentary of the Ari Zal on this verse on page 391 of my commentary on Jacob's impending death, I have explained all this in detail. The approach of the different parts of the soul making up the composite of one's soul, spell the imminence of physical death. The verse in Psalms then has to be translated as: ""when all the parts of their spirit come together their bodies will die."""
31,14,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:14:3,"והתיצבו באהל מועד, ""and stand both of you in the Tent of Meeting, etc."" This is the first instance where G'd commands Joshua to display a symbol of his new authority in Moses' presence. G'd did this by giving both Moses and Joshua simultaneous instructions using the plural התיצבו. We have explained this word as meaning ""being appointed"" in connection with Deut. 29,12. The word has a similar meaning in Samuel I 13,14 where Samuel tells King Saul ויצוהו ה׳ לנגיד על עמו, that in His heart G'd had already appointed someone else as leader of His people. This was some time before G'd ordered Samuel to anoint one of Yishai's sons as king. G'd's words to Joshua ""for you will bring the children of Israel to the land, etc."" (verse 22) are interpreted in Sanhedrin 8 as another such appointment of Joshua to a position of authority."
31,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vaetchanan 6:1","(Deut. 3:26), “Do not [ever] speak [unto me on this matter] again.]” This is related to what Job said (in Job 20:6-7), “Even though one's height ascends to the heavens, [and his head reaches the clouds]. He perishes forever, like his dung….” With reference to whom did Job say this verse? It only speaks with reference to the day of death. So even though one ascends to the heavens and makes himself wings like a bird; when his time to die arrives, his wings are broken, and he falls before the angel of death like an animal before the butcher. So also has David said (in Ps. 146:4), “His spirit departs; he returns to the ground.” And Job has already stated (in Job 3:19), “The small and the great are there, and the slave ('eved) is free from his master.” As even if his master bought him for thousands and thousands of gold coins, once [the slave’s] time to die has come, he cannot say, “He is my slave,” but rather he becomes free from his master. Another interpretation (of Job 20:6), “Even though one's height ascends to the heavens.” This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and who came to the Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with Him (i.e., with the Holy One, blessed be He,) face to face and received the Torah from His hand. When his time to die arrived, He said to him (in Deut. 31:14), “Behold the days are drawing near for you to die.” [Moses] said to Him, “Master of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before Your children like a horse, that my end be for the worm? R. Abbahu said, “To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said, ‘This is suitable only for the king.’ What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift. (Gk.: doron.)  The king said, ‘Cut off his head with it.’ So also Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘By the word that I [used to] praise (Rt.: KLS. Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  you, when I said (in Deut. 10:14), “Behold (hen), the heavens [and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it] belong to the Lord your God!’ By that [very] word (i.e., hen) You are decreeing death over me, when you say (in Deut. 31:14), “Behold (hen), the days are drawing near for you to die.”’” (Below, Deut. 11:6.)  He said to him, “Moses, I have already decreed (Rt.: QLS. Cf. Lat.: census; Gk.: kensos.)  death over the first Adam.” He said to him, “My master, the first Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. Hence it is fitting for him to die. [God] said to him, “Consider Abraham, [who] sanctified My name in My world [but still died].” He said to him, “Master of the world, From Abraham there came out Ishmael, whose race provoked You to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) ‘The tents of robbers prosper, [and those who provoke God have security, the ones whom God brought forth in His hand].’” He said to him, “Consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar.” He said to him, “From Isaac there came out Esau, who in the future will destroy the Temple and burn Your sanctuary.” He said to him, “Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes without any flaw.” He said to him “Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he was not like the ministering angels, he did not receive Torah from Your hand and he did not speak with you face to face.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Deut. 3:26), “Enough from you; do not [ever] speak [unto Me on this matter] again.” He said to Him, “Perhaps [future] generations will say, ‘If He had not found bad things in Moses, He would not have removed him from the world.” He said to him, “I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10), “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.” He said in front of Him, “The people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age.” He said to him, “I have already written (in Deut. 32:51), “Because you acted faithlessly with me.” (Cf. Numb. 20:12.)  He said to Him, “Please let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years there, and after that let me die.” He said to him (in Deut. 32:52), “And there you shall not go.” He said to Him, “If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death.” He said to him, “Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead.” He said in front of Him, “Why all this anger against me?” He said to him (according to Deut. 32:51), “Because you did not sanctify Me.” He said to him, “With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29), ‘Behold, God does all these things two or three times to a man’; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. First you said, (in Exod. 4:13) ‘Please make someone else your agent’; secondly (in Exod. 5:23), ‘For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, [he has dealt worse with this people, and You have still not delivered Your people]’; thirdly (in Numb. 11:22) ‘If the sheep and cattle would be slaughtered for them , would it be [enough] for them’; fourthly (in Numb. 16:29), ‘The Lord did not send me’; fifthly (in Numb. 20:10), ‘Listen, you rebels, [shall we bring forth water for you from this rock]’; (See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.)  sixth (in Numb. 32:14), ‘And now you brood of sinners have arisen in place of your ancestors.’ But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children?” He said to Him, “I have learned so from You, when you said (in Numb. 17:3), ‘The censers of these who have sinned [at the cost of their lives].’ He said to him, “I said (ibid.), ‘At the cost of their lives,’ and not, ‘at the cost of their ancestors.’” He said in front of Him, “I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before You a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, You forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads [because of me], yet You are not taking care of me.” He said to him, “Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now [the] time was delivered into your hands, but from now [the] time is not delivered into your hands.” He said to Him, “Master of the universe, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which You shall bring on my body. So do not deliver me to the pangs of the angel of death. Moreover, if You do this, I will proclaim Your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17), ‘I shall not die, but live [and recount the works of the Lord].’” He said to him (in vs. 20), “This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall come through it.” [From this it follows that] death has been ordained from time immemorial for the righteous and for all mortals. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to the heaven and earth, where he said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “Before seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6), ‘for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment.’” (See ‘AZ 17a, for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.)  He went to the stars and planets. He said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “Before seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 34:4), ‘All the host of heaven shall rot away….’” He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “[Before seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10), ‘For the mountains shall move, and the hills shall be shaken.’” (The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical translations but fits the sense of the midrash.)  He went to the Great Sea. He said to it, “Seek mercy for me.” [The sea] said to him, “Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of [other] days? Are you not the son of Amram, who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12), ‘Who had His glorious arm walk at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them […].’ So what has happened to you today?” When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2), “’O that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me!’ When I passed through you, I was a world king; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me.” Immediately he betook himself to the arch[angel] of the [Divine] Presence and said to him, “Seek mercy for me, that I not die.” He said to him, “My master, Moses, why the exertion? This is what I have heard from behind the curtain: (Pargod. Cf. Lat.: paragauda or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: Paragaudes (a garment with a purple border).)  That your prayer is not heard on this matter.” Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said, “With whom shall I seek mercy for myself?” R. Simlay said, “At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26), ‘But the Lord was angry with me […],’ until Moses began by uttering this Scripture (Exod. 34:6): ‘Then the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “the Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger…].’” Immediately the holy spirit was cooled off.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed.” He said before Him, “You are coming to me with a plot. You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed.” He said to him, “Master of the Universe, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from Your hands lick the dust? Woe! (Vay.)  All mortals will say, “If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with Him face to face, and received Torah from His hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, blessed be He, how much the worse it will be for [mere] flesh and blood, who comes with no [merit from] Torah and with no [merit from the] commandments?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Why all this anguish that you are experiencing?” He said, “Master of the world, I am afraid of the pangs of the angel of death.” He said to him, “I am not delivering you into his hands.” He said in front of Him, “Master of the universe, my mother Jochebed, who was distressed (literally, whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be distressed by my death.” He said to him, “So has it come up in [My] mind, and so is it the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators, (Gk.: pronoi (“prudent ones”).)  every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve in front of Me, but now your lot is over and the time of your disciple Joshua for him to serve [Me] has arrived.” He said to him, “My Master, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple!” He said to him, “If you want to do that, go and do it.” Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door. (Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.)  Now Joshua was seated expounding [Torah], so Moses stopped to bend his stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself to death. When Israel came to Moses' door to study Torah, they asked and said, “Where did Moshe our master [go]?” [Others] said to them, “He got up early and went to the door of Joshua.” [So] they went and found him at the door of Joshua, with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua, “What has come over you that Moses our master stands, while you sit?” When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said, “O my master, my master! My father, my father and lord!” Israel said to Moses, “Moses our master, teach us Torah.” He said to them, “I am not allowed.” They said to him, “We are not leaving you.” A heavenly voice (bat qol) came forth and said to them, “Learn from Joshua.” [So] they took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with [Elazar and Ithamar] to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said that R. Johanan said, “When Joshua opened by saying, ‘Blessed be the One who has chosen the righteous,” they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose [from the session], they said to Moses, “[Explain] the Torah [we have just heard] to us.” He said to them, “I do not know what to answer you.” So Moses our master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said, “Master of the universe, up to now I requested life, but now here is my soul given over to You.” Then when he had resigned himself to death, the Holy One, blessed be He, opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16), “’Who will stand for Me (In context, the word, me, here is self-referential to the author of Psalms, and not referring to God.)  against evildoers?’ Who will stand for Israel in the time of My wrath? Who will stand in the battle of My children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before Me?” At that time Metatron (Lat.: metator (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).)  came and fell on his face. He said to Him, “Master of the world, [as] in Moses' life he belonged to You, so in his death he belongs to You.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day, his father was angry with him and sought to kill him because he did not maintain respect for the father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. His servants said to him, ‘Our lord king, why are you weeping?’ He said to them, ‘It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, did she rescue him from my hand?’” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Metatron, “It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered Me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before Me to turn back My anger from destroying them.” They came and said to Moses, “The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said to them, “Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them.” He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said, “The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world.” He said to Israel, “I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me.” They said to him, “Our lord master, you are forgiven.” Israel also arose before him and said to him, “O Moses our master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us.” He said to them, “You are forgiven.” They came and said to him, “The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said, “Blessed be the name of the One who lives and abides forever.” He said to Israel, “If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones, and you shall say, ‘Woe (oy) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness.’” They came and said to him, “The half moment has arrived.” He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel, “See the final end of flesh and blood.” They answered and said, “The hands which received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall to the grave.” At that moment his soul departed with a kiss (from the Holy One, blessed be He), (See MQ 28a.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5), “Then Moses [the servant of the Lord] died there [in the Land of Moab at the command of the Lord (literally, by the mouth of the Lord)].” (BB 17a; ARN, A 12:2; Cant. R. 1:2:5; Petirat Mosheh Rabbenu, recension A, in A. Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrasch (Leipzig: Vollrath, 1853-57), vol. I, p. 129; ibid., recension B, in Jellinek, vol. VI, p. 77.)  Now [the ones who] took care of his burial were neither Israel nor the angels but the Holy One, blessed be He, [Himself], as stated (in vs. 6), “Then He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) buried him (Moses) in the valley [in the Land of Moab].” And for what reason was he buried outside the land? So that those who die when outside the land might live [again] through his merit, (The translation here follows the traditional Tanhuma. Deut. 2:6. So also Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34. The Buber text omits “might live again” and reads “through their merit.”)  as stated (in Deut. 33:21), “He has chosen the best for himself, [for there is an honored lawgiver's portion].” But when did Moses our master die? On the seventh of Adar, (Seder ‘Olam Rabbah, 10; TSot. 11:7; Qid. 38a; see Meg. 13b; Sot. 12b.)  as stated (in Deut. 34:5), “Then Moses the servant of the Lord died there [in the Land of Moab].” It is also written (in vs. 8), “And the children of Israel mourned Moses [on the Plains of Moab for thirty days.]” And it is written (in Josh. 1:1), “And it came to pass after the death of Moses, [the servant of the Lord, the Lord spoke unto Joshua]”; (Josh. 4:19) “Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month (i.e., Nisan).” Reckon back thirty-three days [from then]. Ergo, he died on the seventh of Adar. And where is it shown that he was born on the seventh of Adar? Where it is stated (in Deut. 31:2), “He said to them, ‘I am one hundred twenty years old today.’” (Since Moses spoke these words on the day of his death, his birthday must have been the same as the day of his death.)  What is the text teaching with, “today?” Today, I have fulfilled my days and any years. [It is there] to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He, fulfills the years for the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as stated (in Exod. 23:26), “I will fulfill the number of your days.”"
31,14,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 47:28:2","In this verse Solomon wishes to extol the virtue of charity in the wake of which much reward may be expected; in fact, the performance of that good deed may add years to one’s life (compare Psalms 19,12). The practice of charity is a panacea for both body and soul. It is capable of overcoming what is in store for people based on the mazzal they have been born under. We have proof of this in Samuel I 26,10 where David speaks of: “or his time will come and he will die.” What he meant was that the person’s day of death will approach sooner than had been originally scheduled. Death may sometimes occur sooner than originally scheduled, such as in the case of David of whom we read in Kings I 2,1 “David’s days approached to die.” On the other hand, there are instances when years are added to the life of a person who had been born under horoscopic influences which presaged a much shorter life for him. The best known example of this was the King Chiskiyah who, though he had been told by the prophet Isaiah to make his last will and testament, was granted an additional 15 years in response to his prayer (Isaiah 38,4-8).  Conversely, we find that the life span of a person may be shortened from what had originally been decreed for him as we find in the case of King Yehoram son of Achazyah who was punished for his idolatry. We find in Kings II 1,16 that Elijah told him: “because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zevuv the god of Ekron — as if there were no G’d in Israel whose word you could seek — assuredly you shall not rise from the bed which you are lying on but you shall die.” This is what prompted Solomon to say that charity is such a powerful virtue that it can overcome even decrees of death. Its power is equal to that of “being fruitful and multiplying.” The word חיים in the sequence בארח צדקה חיים means that an additional life span may be granted in recognition of the charity one practices. The word מות, “death,” in the second half of our verse refers to shortening someone’s life expectancy as retribution for some sin committed.   We are told in Baba Batra 11 that a certain righteous individual Binyamin, who was in charge of the distribution of public charity once had a certain woman approach him during a year of famine. The woman said to him: “please support me!” He answered her that there were no funds left in the kuppah. Thereupon she said to him: “if you do not provide me with food, a woman and her seven children will surely die.” He then gave her of his own money. Some time later, this very Binyamin fell sick and was on the point of death. At that point the angels said to G’d: “did You not say that anyone who keeps alive even a single Jew is considered as if he had kept a whole world alive? Did not this Binyamin save the lives of a woman and her seven children? Why does he have to die so young?” Thereupon the decree ordering his death was torn up and he had 22 years added to his life span.  The words ודרך נתיבה אל מות mean that because a person is performing constant acts of charity he may be certain that he does not die prematurely. Translated literally: “there is no death on its path.” This idea is expressed also by Proverbs 10,2 צדקה תציל ממות, “charity saves from death.” This means that the person who practices charity does not die before his appointed time thanks to his acts of charity. Seeing that on occasion acts of charity are the reason why someone’s life span is extended beyond what was originally decreed, it is only logical that such acts protect the person performing them against dying prematurely.  The subject matter of charity, how to practice it, and in what amount to practice it is quite complicated; the fundamental ingredient of doing charity is that one gives to someone else something which belongs to one. There are many ways of doing this. A minimal performance of the commandment would be giving a small alms to a Gentile. The next higher level of charity would be giving a similar amount to a Jewish person from another town who is in need. A still higher level of charity is giving this amount to a needy Jew from your own city. This is based on Exodus 22,24 “the poor person who lives amongst you.” A poor person residing in your house takes precedence in his claim on your charity over someone who lives out of town. A poor person who is also a next of kin takes precedence over another poor person of your hometown. The relevant verse in Isaiah 58,7 states: “do not ignore your own kin.” A still higher level of charity is to provide one’s children with a livelihood. Our sages (Ketuvot 50) applied to this Psalms 106,3 “Happy are those who do right at all times.” They argued that it is not possible to do right at all times as most people do not become called upon to perform acts of charity all the time. The only way they can fulfill what the psalmist talks about is by providing for their children while they are minors. The next higher level of performing charity is looking after one’s aged parents financially. By doing this one also fulfills the commandment to honour father and mother. This is the finest way of doing charity. When one does this one may be in line for living to a ripe old age oneself. This is why the Torah wrote in connection with this commandment (Exodus 20,12) “in order that you may experience long life on the earth that the Lord your G’d is assigning to you.” This is precisely what Solomon termed בארך צדקה חיים, that the path to life is righteousness. G’d repays measure for measure. If children keep their parents alive longer by ensuring that they can enjoy their old age, G’d in turn will recompense the children in a similar manner.  We see a perfect example of this principle in the relationship between Yaakov and Joseph. Yaakov had provided for Joseph during the first 17 years of his life; in our Parshah we are told that Joseph repaid his father by providing for him during the last 17 years of his life. This is why the Torah (Genesis 47,28) was at pains to write: “Yaakov lived in Egypt for 17 years.” [Had the Torah not wanted to make this point it could simply have written that Yaakov lived for a total of 147 years. We know that he was 130 years old when he was presented to Pharaoh. Ed.]"

M.Ḳ. loc. cit. has ‘five’ instead of ‘six’, quotes Deut. 31, 14, Behold thy days approach that thou must die and explains: behold accounts for one (cf. Sonc. ed., loc. cit., n. 6), thy days accounts for two more, approach gives a further two, which makes five.)  after seven days, it is a death of [divine] love; after a longer period, it is a death of suffering."
31,14,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:7,"Why was Moses privileged that the Holy One blessed be He tended to him? (God tended to his burial.)  It is, rather, that when he descended to Egypt, and the time for Israel’s redemption had arrived, all of Israel was occupied with silver and gold. Moses was circulating in the city and exerting himself three days and three nights to find Joseph’s coffin, as they were not able to depart from Egypt without Joseph. Why? It is because he administered an oath to them before his death, as it is stated: “Joseph administered an oath to the children of Israel, saying…[and you shall carry up my bones from here]” (Genesis 50:25). After he was extremely exhausted, Segula (Elsewhere, she is identified as Seraḥ daughter of Asher (Sota 13a).)  encountered him, and saw that Moses was exhausted from the exertion. She said to him: ‘My lord, Moses, why are you tired?’ He said to her: ‘For three days and three nights I have circulated in the city to find Joseph’s coffin, but I have not found it.’ She said to him: ‘Come with me and I will show you where he is.’ She led him to the stream, (The Nile River.)  she said to him: ‘In this place they crafted a coffin weighing five hundred talents, and the magicians and the astrologers cast it into the stream. Thus they said to Pharaoh: If it is your wish that this nation will never depart from here, Joseph’s bones, if they never find them, they will be unable to leave.’   Moses immediately stood on the bank of the stream and said: ‘Joseph, you know how you administered an oath to Israel: “God will remember you [and you shall bring up my bones with you]” (Genesis 50:25). Accord deference to the God of Israel and do not delay the redemption of Israel. You have good deeds to your credit; ask for mercy before your Creator and rise from the depths.’ Immediately, Joseph’s coffin began bubbling and rising from the depths like a piece of wood. He took it, placed it on his shoulder, and he would bear it, with all of Israel following him. Israel were bearing the gold and the silver that they took from Egypt, and Moses was bearing Joseph’s coffin. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, you say that you performed a minor action; as you live, this kindness that you performed is great, and you did not pay attention to the silver and the gold. I, too, will perform this kindness for you, and I will tend to you.’"
31,14,Jewish Thought,"Leadership in the Wilderness; Authority and Anarchy in the Book of Numbers, Part III, Chapter 15; Losing a Leader 23","Moses received forewarning of death like his brother, but unlike his brother he was told long before, in the book of Numbers, chapter 20, only to die at the end of Deuteronomy 34. He is told again and again that he would sleep with his ancestors. (See Deuteronomy 31:14, 31:16, and 32:49–50.)  Why is he told on several occasions to ascend a mountain to see the place from afar that he would never enter? Why did God not hearken to his plea, “Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan” (Deut. 3:25)? Why was this fighter allowed more time to prepare for his final debate than his siblings?"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,14,Midrash,Ruth Rabbah 2:18,"Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abbahu interpreted the verse as referring to Moses. Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, I lauded you with the word hen, as it is stated: “Behold [hen], to the Lord are the heavens and the heaven of heavens” (Deuteronomy (10:14), and I believed that You would accord me greatness. “Would you constrain yourselves for them [halahen te’agena],” instead, You caused the angel of death to touch me [hogatani], You forsook my hen, and You said to me: “Behold [hen], your days approach that you must die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). Then he [Moses] said to Israel: “No [al], my daughters,” woe [alelai] my children, “for I am greatly embittered for you,” because of you, “as the hand of God has emerged against me” and my brother [Aaron]."

31,14,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:14,"The Lord said to Moses: Behold, your days are drawing near for you to die. Summon Joshua, and both of you stand in the Tent of Meeting, the Tabernacle, and there I will command him, appoint him to his new task. Moses and Joshua went and stood in the Tent of Meeting. Moses could speak with God face-to-face, as it were, in the Tent of Meeting. On this occasion, he took Joshua with him as well. Their entrance together into the Tent of Meeting was a public, ceremonial act, and presumably, even those not invited to witness this event came to see what was happening."
31,14,Quoting Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 5","“The time is drawing near for you to die” [31:14]. The day of your death is near. This verse teaches us that the Holy One decrees the time of how long the person should live and the Holy One makes the people approach the stated time for the person. Sometimes, the Holy One lengthens the time and he lives longer. Sometimes, the Holy one shortens his life. It is known that the Holy One has given everything into the power of the constellations in heaven to make someone rich and poor, as the Talmud says in [tractate Moed Katan], chapter three. The life of the person, children for the person, and food for the person, all these do not depend on the merit of good deeds, but depend on the constellations. Ravah and Rav Hisdah were both very righteous. One of them lived forty years and the other one lived sixty years. In the house of Ravah, his household did not have enough barley bread and at Rav Hisdah’s, the household did not want to eat fine flour bread, since there was so much of it in his house. Even though the Holy One placed these three things in the power of the constellations, but in any event the Holy One has power over them and can change them when the Holy One so desires, as we find concerning Hezekiah. He was supposed to die. The Holy One said: I will lengthen his stated years, so that he should live longer, another fifteen years. Sometimes, the Holy One shortens someone’s life, as we find concerning Ahaziah son of Ahab. He worshiped foreign gods and the Holy One shortened his life, as the verse says, “you shall not rise from the bed which you are lying on; but you shall die” [II Kings, 1:16]. This means, the prophet told him: you might have lived longer, but because you have worshiped foreign gods, therefore you must quickly die, before your time comes. The Holy One has power over the constellations to change them. The person can avert everything with his merits, even if the constellation points to an evil end, but the person has anguish in his heart and even if he does not pray, yet he averts the evil constellation with his anguish, as the verse says, “He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him” [Psalms, 145:19]. This means, the Holy One does the will of the righteous, what they desire with their heart and in their prayers. However, three things are decided above, having children, having enough food, and living long. These, the person cannot abrogate the constellation, but he must pray, as the verse says, “He hears their cry and delivers them” [Psalms, 145:19]. He can abrogate the evil decree with prayer, and the Holy One gives him children, enough food, and long life. We find this regarding Rachel, who had no children, as the verse says, “God heeded her and opened her womb” [Genesis, 30:22]. This means, the Holy One heard the prayer of Rachel and gave her children. We also find this with regard to long life for Hezekiah, as the verse says, “I have heard your prayer … I hereby add fifteen years to your life” [Isaiah, 38:5]. This means, I have heard your prayer. I will lengthen your life by fifteen years. The food we find concerning Elijah and Elisha. God gave them food when there was famine. Therefore, our sages taught us that one could abrogate the constellation, to have children through prayer; similarly, with food and long life. The Midrash writes: Moses said, with the word “Mark … to the Lord your God” [Deuteronomy, 10:14]. I have praised you always and now You tell me with the word “Mark” that I will die. That is to say, You said, “Mark, the time is drawing near for you to die” [31:14]. The Holy One responded: with that which you praised Me, with that you will die. That is to say, death is a favor for you. You will also have more honor in the world to come. Our sages learn from here that the Holy One will bring the dead back to life. Therefore, it says, “you are soon to lie … and will arise” [31:16]. This means, though you will lie in the grave, you will rise again. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:14.) "
31,14,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 10:2,"“And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them; After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei” (Deuteronomy 1:3-4). (Guggenheimer notes that this means that all laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given either at the time of consecration of the Tabernacle, or during the second year after the Exodus. He also notes that the remaining 38 years are without record except for the list of stations (Num. 33) and the few remarks in Deuteronomy quoted at the end of this chapter. )  From the first of Shevat until the sixth of Adar, thirty-six days, did Moses our Teacher expound the entire Torah. On the sixth [of Adar] ""And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die..."" (Deuteronomy 31:14). (R. Jacob Emdin asks, if you have a difficulty understanding why Scripture reduced one year from the life of the righteous [Moses], see what he wrote in his Sefer Yaavetz, Section 133, at the end of this chapter. Guggenheimer notes that the computation of the date of Moses's death is quoted at length in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 38a, and in a shortened version, in Tosefta Sotah 11, in both versions of Tanhuma, and in Deut. Rabba, end of Vaethanan, and Sifry Deut. 304.  He notes that according to all sources, Moses died on 7 Adar. He explains that Josephus puts Moses's death on 1 Adar because he simply copied the dates of the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. )  On the seventh of Adar ""And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day..."" (Deuteronomy 31:1-2). Why does Scripture say ""this day""? It says ""this day"" to teach us that on the seventh of Adar was Moses born, and on the seventh of Adar he died, as it is written ""So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated"" (Deuteronomy 34:5-7). (R. Jacob Emdin notes that he explains in his Sefer Yaavetz which day of the week was 7 Adar. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the argument is based on the verses ""an hundred and twenty years old this day"" (Deut. 31:2), and ""And there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the number of your days I will fulfil"" (Ex. 23:26), which mean that the just will complete the full measure of their years.  Guggenheimer notes that the first part of Ex. 23:26 speaks of the general blessing bestowed on Israel and the second part is addressed to Moses personally.)  ""And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan..."" ""And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it"" (Joshua 1:1-2,10-11). ""And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho"" (Joshua 4:19). (Guggenheimer notes that the verse ""Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise"" (Joshua 1:2) means that Joshua should act immediately, on the day following the 30 days of mourning.  He notes that according to this verse, Israel crossed the Jordan on 10 Nisan. Hence, the mourning started on the day of Moses's death, and to compute that day, one has to subtract 32 from 39.)  Count from there thirty-three days backwards, and you will learn that Moses our teacher died on the seventh of Adar.   Three good providers arose for Israel, and these are they: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through them to Israel, and these are they: the well, and the pillar of cloud, and the Mannah. The Mannah was [given] by the merit of Moses, the pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, the well by the merit of Miriam. Miriam died, the well disappeared, it was given back to Israel by the merit of Moses and Aaron. Aaron died, the pillar of cloud disappeared, it was given back to them by the merit of Moses. [Moses died], (R. Eliyahu from Vilna adds ""Moses died"" here.  The bracket is a later addition.)   all three disappeared, and they did not return, as it is written ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" (Zechariah 11:8). Did they die in one month? They died in one year! Miriam died on the tenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is a Tosephta of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, reported in the Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 9a).  Guggenheimer notes that Megilat Taanit, which reports the same tradition, probably also is from the school of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, in contrast to Josephus who puts Miriam's death on the first of Nissan.  R. Jacob Emdin, however, notes that R. Yose the son of R. Judah's opinion is accepted by Yerushalmi sources, such as the Yerushalmi Targum (Pseudo-Jonathan) to Num. 20, and copied from there by the Gaonic Halakhot Gedolot, and the medieval Tur and Shulhan Arukh.)   and Aaron on the first of Av, (R. Jacob Emdin notes that this disagrees with the Talmud, which puts the death of Aaron in Tammuz.  Guggenheimer notes that French manuscripts have ""first of Tammuz.""  He explains that in Seder Olam, Av always has 30 days.)   and Moses our teacher on the seventh of Adar. Rather, on the day that Moses died, all three disappeared and never returned. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that, according to Seder Olam, all three good providers died in different months and the verse ""And I cut off the three shepherds in one month"" does not refer to the month of their death, but to the month in which the Temple was destroyed.  R. Jacob Emdin interprets the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 17a, that the wicked are judged for 12 months in Gehinnom, but that according to R. Yohanan ben Nuri the 12 months are counted from Passover to Shavuot, to mean that R. Yohanan ben Nuri holds that only the three Pilgrimage Festivals have the full status of Shabbatot.  He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.)   From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read ""Shabbat"" instead of ""Sunday"" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement ""on the seventh of Adar they ate..."" refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain"" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.)  as it is written ""And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."" (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say ""And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. ""They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan"", (The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets ""yamim"" in ""yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim"" (1 Sam. 27:7) as ""two days and four months"" and not as ""one year and four months"" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads ""four months,"" not ""about four months.""   Guggenheimer explains that the word ""yamim"" in the verse cited here, that usually means ""days,"" must mean ""two days"" since by the principle ""Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,"" if ""yamim"" meant ""years,"" then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. )  that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared. (R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is ""39 years"" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 ""years of servitude"" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.)  That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt, (R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), ""the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."")   which were good for them, like the Mannah. "
31,14,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"הן קרבו ימיך למות, “the time is approaching when you must die;” Moses had said to G–d that he had employed the word הן when praising Him, as is recorded in Deut. 10,14: הן לה' אלוקיך השמים ושמי השמים הארץ וכל אשר בם, “Mark, the heavens to their uppermost reaches belong to the Lord your G–d, the earth and all that is in it.” Why do You decree death upon me by using the same introductory word? G–d reminded Moses that he had used the same word also when challenging G–d’s judgment in Exodus 6,12 when he complained that since had commenced his mission the suffering of his people had become more severe. He felt that he was not being dealt with fairly. G–d explained to him that he erred and that what He had decreed was for his own good. How so? We read in Proverbs 11,31: הן בארץ ישלם אף כי רשע וחוטא, ‘”if the righteous will be recompensed on earth, how much more so the wicked and the sinner!” G–d assured Moses that in the world to come he would occupy a throne made of precious stones and would be seated on a loftier platform than 550000 righteous people. An alternate interpretation of the word הן, there is no other word in the Hebrew language which is a match for the word הן. What is meant by this? The word אחד 1 when matched with the word תשעה, 9 makes ten. The word שנים 2 when matched with the word שמונה, 8, makes ten. The word (number) 5, as well as the word 50 have no partners. Moses, i.e. his name, has no partners, as the Torah testifies that no other human being emerged who could match Moses. (Midrash Devarim Rabbah 9,6 as well as 11,9) Therefore, Moses being unique had to be matched with G–d Who is unique."
31,14,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 96:4,"Reish Lakish said: [God said:] ‘As you live, you will lie down, but you will not die,’ as it is stated: “The time for Israel to die approached.” (Although Jacob’s body would cease to function, he would not die. The verse cited can be more literally translated: “The days of Israel drew near to death,” implying that Jacob’s days would die, meaning he would no longer function in the physical world, but he himself would not die (Maharzu). )  What is “approached [vayikrevu]”? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The day complains against you, saying that it would stand still.’ (Since Jacob was supposed to die on that day, the day would not be able to end without him dying. )  It is like a person who says: ‘So-and-so has attacked [karav] another.’ That is “vayikrevu.” (The midrash portrays the day, as it were, submitting a claim against Jacob, that he must die on that day. )    Everyone in whose regard it is written that the time for him [to die] approached, did not reach the days of his ancestors. “Approach” is written with regard to David – “the time for David to die approached” (I Kings 2:1). He did not reach the days of his ancestors. Of Boaz, Oved, and Yishai, the Sages said that they lived more than four hundred years, but David lived only seventy years. He did not reach the days of his ancestors; therefore “approach” is written in his regard. Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years, but Moses lived only one hundred and twenty years; therefore, “approach” is written in his regard: “Behold, your days are approaching to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). And Jacob, approach is written in his regard, as he did not reach the days of his ancestors. Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years, Isaac, one hundred and eighty, and Jacob, one hundred and forty-seven. That is why “approach” is written in his regard – “the time for Israel to die approached.”"
31,14,Halakhah,"Care of the Critically Ill, Quality and Sanctity of Life in the Talmud and Midrash Coauthored by Dr Fred Rosner, Mental Anguish 7","The other homiletical passage deals with the imminent death of Moses. (Deuteronomy Rabbah 9: 9.)  When God told Moses to call his successor Joshua (Deut. 31:14), Moses said to God, ""Master of the Universe, let Joshua take over my office and I will continue to live."" Whereupon God replied, ""Treat him as he treats you."" Immediately Moses arose early and went to Joshua's house, and Joshua became frightened. Moses said to Joshua: ""My teacher came to me,"" and they set out to go, Moses walking on the left of Joshua as a disciple walks on the left of his teacher. When they entered the Tent of Meeting (Ohel Moed) the pillar of cloud came down and separated them. When the pillar of cloud departed, Moses approached Joshua and asked him, ""What was revealed to you?"" Joshua replied, ""When the word was revealed to you did I know what God spoke with you?"" At that moment Moses exclaimed: ""Better to die a hundred times than to experience envy, even once."" Solomon has expressed this clearly: ""For love is strong as death, jealousy is evil as the grave"" (Song of Songs 8:6). This refers to the love wherewith Moses loved Joshua, and the jealousy of Moses toward Joshua. A life of envy and jealousy is not worth living for a man of the ethical stature of our Teacher, Moses."
31,15,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:15:1,"AND THE ETERNAL APPEARED IN THE TENT IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD. The purport thereof is that the pillar of cloud was over the entrance [of the Tent] and G-d appeared in the Tent — this being the Glory, according to Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. In my opinion, this verse is like And the Eternal came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent; (Ibid., 12:5.)  and, behold, the Glory of the Eternal appeared in the cloud. (Exodus 16:10.)  And the meaning [of the verse here] is that He wanted to speak with Moses so that Joshua would hear, and He would also charge Joshua there. Now, to Moses it was said, And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover (Ibid., 25:22.)  but Joshua was not of that exalted status [in prophecy] and he was forbidden to enter the Tent altogether. Thus the phrase, and the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the Tent (In Verse 15 before us.)  reverts to explain that the cloud, in which was the Glory, was above the door of the Tent covering it, and accordingly He was in the Tent [as the verse states, And the Eternal appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud]."
31,15,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:15:1,"AND THE LORD APPEARED IN THE TENT. The specified tent. (The tent of meeting mentioned in the previous verse. Hence the word ohel (tent) has a heh ha-yedi’ah prefixed to it.)  The meaning of our verse is that the pillar of cloud was at the door of the tent and God was seen inside the tent. This (The pillar of cloud.)  is what the glory (The glory of God.)  refers to. (When Scripture speaks of the glory of God appearing in the tent of meeting, the reference is to the pillar of cloud. See Ex. 16:10.)  The statement that I may give him a charge (v. 14) refers to And he (Moses.)  gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge (v. 23) by the command of God, may He be blessed. Scripture therefore reads, which I swore unto them (Ibid.). (Moses uses the term “I” because he was speaking for God by God’s command.)  After this came the passage Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers (v. 16). (According to I.E. the sequence of events was as follows: Verses 14,15; 23; 16-22; 9. The reason for the aforementioned is purely exegetical. It allows for a logical, sequential unfolding of events.)  There is no chronological order in the Torah. The passage And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law (v. 24) is connected to (It follows.)  And Moses wrote this law (v. 9)."

31,15,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 4:7:5,"ואתה תמשול בו, he will have control over you only if you do not actively remove him (it) from your presence. If you want to, you can control it, govern it, resulting in your humbling it before you. By saying these words G’d demonstrated to Kayin the immense power inherent in his possessing free choice. Moses repeated this thought at the end of his life when in his parting speech he said to the Jewish people (Deut. 30,15) ראה נתתי לפניך היום את החיים ואת הטוב ואת המות ואת הרע. “See here, I have placed before you this day life, and the good, or death and the evil.” Moses added the admonition: ”choose the life!”

31,15,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:15:1","ויעמוד עמוד הענן על פתח האהל, “the pillar of cloud stood by the entrance to the Tent.” Nachmanides writes that the reason for this was that G’d wanted to speak to Moses in such a way that Joshua would be able to hear the voice of G’d. G’d wanted Joshua to hear, but He also wanted him to know that he had not attained the stature of Moses. Only Moses had ever been told (Exodus 25,22) ונועדתי לך שם ואדבר אתך מעל הכפורת, “I will set My meetings with you there, and I will speak with you from above the lid of the Holy Ark.” Joshua did not have permission to enter the Tabernacle. This is why the Torah writes that on this occasion, in order for Joshua to hear G’d’s voice, the pillar of cloud, signifying the cover within which G’d’s glory was situated, moved from the inner Sanctum where the Holy Ark was located, to the eastern entrance of the Tabernacle.

31,15,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:35,"The ninth principle is the destruction of lust. He must lay it to his heart that lust ruins all deeds. And he should abstain from luxuries, even from things which are permitted to him. And he should conduct himself in the paths of abstinence, eating only to satisfy his hunger and to preserve his body. And the same is true in his relationship to woman. For whenever a man follows after lust he is drawn after the functions of the body and separates himself from the ways of the cultured soul. Then his evil inclination overpowers him, as it is written, ""But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked"" (Deut, 31:15). And it is written, ""Lest I be full, and deny, and say : 'Who is the Lord?' "" (Prov. 30:9). Now the lust that is given into the heart of a man is the root of all deeds. Therefore he must hurry to correct that lust, and on this subject we have dwelt above. And there is a great benefit in the breaking of lust, for in this way a man reveals that his heart is good and upright, and that he rejects the character which sin has caused him to have. And one who abstains even from what is permitted erects a great fence which will keep him from touching what is forbidden. It is as if he says, ""Even in that which is permitted I do not satisfy my craving; how then shall I stretch forth my hands to that which is forbidden?"""

He has explained it well. And in the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra: (Found in Ibn Ezra on Verse 15.)  “And he commanded Joshua — that is, Moses [commanded] by order of G-d, and therefore he said, into the Land which I swore unto them.” Similarly we find that Moses said, And I will give the rain of your Land in its season. (Above, 11:14.)  So also, And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle. (Ibid., Verse 15.)  Likewise, that ye might know that I am the Eternal your G-d. (Above, 29:5.)  And so also, The Eternal will send upon thee the scantiness etc. because of the evil doings, whereby thou hast forsaken Me. (Above, 28:20.)  I have already discussed this. (See above, 5:12.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,15,Quoting Commentary,Radak on II Chronicles 6:1:1,"To dwell in the ‘arafel. This means: [God] said that He would dwell among the Israelites in the ‘arafel—that is, the cloud (‘anan)—as the text says, “I will dwell among the Israelites” (Exod 29:45). That is, His Presence would descend in the cloud on the site of the Sanctuary, to be worshiped. Our Sages, of blessed memory (b. Yoma 53a), say that when [God] said “because I appear in the ‘anan over the Ark-cover” (Lev 16:2), He in fact hinted to them that He would appear in the ‘anan in the eternal Temple. Even though they also explain “in the ‘anan” to mean in the smoke of the incense offering (ibid.), the plain sense of the verse is that it refers to the cloud of the Divine Presence. Indeed, in the Tabernacle, His Presence appeared in the cloud constantly, as the text says, “The Presence of the Lord appeared in a cloud” (cf. Deut 31:15), and: “and there, in a cloud, appeared the Presence of the Lord” (Exod 16:10). And [God] did as He said; for He caused His Presence to dwell in the stately Temple that I built for Him, descending in the cloud."

And likewise, in every place where there was the revelation of His Divine Presence to the lower creatures, it was with the pillar of cloud. And that is why it was fitting that it be by the agency of Aaron, for the connection between God, may He be blessed, and Israel was through Aaron, as was explained."

(Ramban understood Rashi’s words to mean that the term neichar (foreign) applies to the peoples — “the gods of the foreign peoples.” Ramban contends that the term “foreign” applies to the gods, as will be explained.)  Rather, it means “the gods that are foreign to this Land,” for the Glorious Name (Above, 28:58.)  is called the G-d of the Land, similar to what is stated, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land. (II Kings 17:26.)  Similarly, And they spoke of the G-d of Jerusalem, as concerning the gods of the peoples of the earth (II Chronicles 32:19.)  and it is further written, They shall not dwell in the Eternal’s Land.

31,16,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:16:3,"AFTER THE FOREIGN GODS OF THE LAND. We know that God is one. (God is unchangeable. God remains the same at all times.)  Change comes from the recepients. (Of Divine beneficence. According to I.E. praying to God does not change God’s mind. It changes the petitioner. The person changes his fate because he becomes a different person. Thus God’s decrees remain unchangeable.)  God does not change His works, (The laws of nature, or any of His actions.)  for they are executed in wisdom. It is part of the service of God to harness one’s power to receive spiritual inspiration in accordance with the place. (The Land of Israel. According to I.E. if a person follows a certain way of life, i.e., following God’s commandments, certain things will follow automatically. He also believed that God’s influence varies in accordance with the place. Hence certain laws have to be followed in the Land of Israel if the land is to maintain its sanctity and receive the amount of divine influence allotted to it. See I.E. on Gen. 4:14; 28:16. Also see Ex. 15:17.)  Scripture therefore reads, the manner of the God of the land (II Kings 17:26). (The reference is to the people whom the king of Assyria brought to Samaria. They wanted to learn the manner of the God of the land because they knew that if they wanted to remain in the Land of Israel, they would have to alter their ways to fit the religious requirements of the land.)  Jacob therefore said, (To his sons.)  Put away the strange gods (Gen. 35:2). (According to I.E., Jacob told his sons, “Now that we are in the Land of Israel put away the images which you held on to while you were outside of the Land of Israel.”)  The place is unlike other places with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse with women whom Scripture deems as being of close flesh. (A person is not allowed to marry a variety of close relatives. Among these are two sisters and an aunt. However, Jacob married two sisters and Amram married his aunt. According to I.E. they did so because they were outside of the Land of Israel. See I.E. on Lev. 18:26.)  The intelligent will understand. (That the Land of Israel has special spiritual significance.)

31,16,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:16:4,"[AMONG THEM.] Be-kirbo (among them) refers to foreign. (That is, foreign people. Our verse reads, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to he among them. I.E. does not believe that Scripture would use the term “among them” when referring to foreign gods, for such gods do not exist, and it is impossible to come among them. Hence his interpretation.)  Scripture, as it were, states, and go astray after the gods of a foreign people, (The Canaanite nations.)  who are the gods of the land. (In other words, the foreign gods of the land is short for “the foreign people of the gods of the land.”)  However, it appears that be-kirbo refers to the word ha-aretz (of the land), (In this case be-kirbo should be translated as “in it” or “into the midst of it” and our verse rendered, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land into the midst of which they enter.)  for the word eretz is found in the masculine. (Hence the word be-kirbo which is masculine, can refer to eretz. Eretz is usually feminine. Hence I.E.’s comment.)  Compare, And the land (ha-aretz) was not able to bear (nasa) (Nasa is masculine.)  them (Gen. 13:6); the land [is] burnt up (netam (Netam is masculine.)  aretz) (Is. 9:18)."
31,16,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 6:5","What was implied by David's statement [Psalms 25:8-9]: ""God is good and upright, therefore, he instructs sinners in the path. He guides the humble [in the path of justice and] teaches the humble His way]""? That He sends them prophets to inform them of the path of God and to encourage them to repent. Furthermore, it implies that He granted them the power to learn and to understand. This attribute is present in all men: As long as a person follows the ways of wisdom and righteousness, he will desire them and pursue them. This [may be inferred from] the statement of our Sages of blessed memory: ""One who comes to purify [himself] is helped;"" i.e., he finds himself assisted in this matter. [A question may still arise, for] behold, it is written in the Torah [Genesis 15:13]: ""They shall enslave them and oppress them,"" [seemingly implying that] He decreed that the Egyptians would commit evil. Similarly, it is written [Deuteronomy 31:16]: ""And this nation will arise and stray after the alien gods of the land,"" [seemingly implying that] He decreed that Israel would serve idols. If so, why did He punish them? Because He did not decree that a particular person would be the one who strayed. Rather, each and every one of those who strayed to idol-worship [could have chosen] not to serve idols if he did not desire to serve them. The Creator merely informed [Moses] of the pattern of the world. To what can this be compared? To someone who says, there will be righteous and wicked people in this nation. [Thus,] a wicked person cannot say that because God told Moses that there will be wicked people in Israel, it is decreed that he will be wicked. A similar concept applies regarding the statement [Deuteronomy 15:11]: ""The poor will never cease to exist in the land."" Similarly, in regard to the Egyptians, each and every one of the Egyptians who caused hardship and difficulty for Israel had the choice to refrain from harming them, if he so desired, for there was no decree on a particular person. Rather, [God merely] informed [Abraham] that, in the future, his descendants would be enslaved in a land which did not belong to them. We have already explained that it is beyond the potential of man to know how God knows what will be in the future."
31,16,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 31:16,"Adonoy said to Moshe, ‘‘You are about to die, and this people will arise and stray after the gods of the stranger [people] [foreign idols] of the land that they are going there among them, and they will forsake [the fear of] Me and break My covenant that I made with them."
31,16,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 31:16,"And the Lord said to Mosheh, Behold, thou wilt lie down in the dust with thy fathers, and thy soul shall be treasured in the treasury of eternal life with thy fathers: but this wicked people will rise up and go astray after the idols of the nations among whom they come, and will forsake My worship, and change My covenant which I have made with them.  
"
31,16,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:13,"The same answer may also apply to another passage in which God says, ""Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and then will this people rise up and go astray after the gods of the stranger of the land"". (Deut. XXXI, 16.)  This is no more nor less than if God had said, ""Whoever practises idolatry will meet with this or that treatment"", but, if no transgressor should ever be found, then the threat of punishment for idolatry would become nullified, and the curses would all be ineffectual. (Cf. H. T'shubah, loc. cit.)  The same is true of all punishments mentioned in the Law. As we cannot say that simply because we find the law of stoning for Sabbathbreakers [in the Torah] that he who desecrates the Sabbath was compelled to violate it, no more can we maintain that because certain maledictions occur there that those who practised idolatry, and upon whom these curses consequently fell, were predestined to be idol-worshippers. On the contrary, every one who practised idolatry did so of his own volition, and so received due punishment, in consonance with the passage, ""Yea they have made a choice of their own ways ... so will I also make choice of their misfortune"". (Isa. LXVI, 3. 4.) "
31,16,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:16:1,"וקם העם הזה וזנו אחרי אלוהי נכר, ""and this nation will arise and stray after idols, etc."" How can Moses describe such a deviation as a קימה, ""a rising,"" instead of as a ירידה, ""a descent, a degradation?"" Perhaps we may relate the description וקמו to 32,15 where Moses described the Israelites as first waxing fat and as a result ""kicking."" Up until that point Israel had been referred to as ""Yeshurun."" At this point Moses pointedly speaks about העם, the common people rising. The coarsening of the Jewish people was due to their material blessing which G'd had showered upon the nation deserving of the distinctive appellation ""Yeshurun."""
31,16,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 9:1,"“When Pharaoh will speak to you, saying: Provide a wonder for you; then you shall say to Aaron: Take your staff, and cast it before Pharaoh, it will become a serpent” (Exodus 7:9).  “When Pharaoh will speak to you” – Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama began: “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times matters that have not been done; saying: My counsel will stand, and all My desire I will do” (Isaiah 46:10) – the Holy One blessed be He declares at the beginning what will be at the end, as He says to Moses: “This people will rise, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land” (Deuteronomy 31:16), which they were destined to do after the death of Joshua: “And they will forsake Me, and breach My covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:16); “they forsook the Lord and did not worship Him” (Judges 10:6). That is “declaring the end from the beginning.”  Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: Anyone who reads this verse thinks that perhaps there is a dispute on High, as He says: “My counsel will stand [and all My desire I will do].” What is “and all My desire I will do”? It is that He desires to vindicate His creations, as it is stated: “The Lord desires for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious” (Isaiah 42:21), and does not seek to condemn any creature, as it is stated: “I have no desire in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked repent from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Therefore, it is stated: “And all My desire I will do.” Likewise you find that the Holy One blessed be He told Moses the end from the beginning; it is not written: If Pharaoh will speak to you, but rather, “when [Pharaoh] will speak”; he is destined to say this to you.  Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: He is speaking appropriately: “Provide a wonder for you.” Likewise, you find with Noah, after all the miracles that the Holy One blessed be He performed for him in the ark, and He took him out of it, He said to him: “And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh” (Genesis 9:15). [Noah] began asking for a sign, (That there would never again be a flood.)  until the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I have set My rainbow in the cloud” (Genesis 9:13); if the righteous Noah asked for a sign, all the more so, the wicked Pharaoh [would].  Likewise, you find with Hezekiah, when Isaiah came and said to him: “So says the Lord…I will heal you; on the third day you will go up to the house of the Lord” (II Kings 20:5), he began asking for a sign, as it is stated: “Hezekiah said…what is the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?” (II Kings 20:8). If the righteous Hezekiah asked for a sign, all the more so, the wicked Pharaoh [would].  Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, when they descended into the fiery furnace, they descended only with a sign. How so? “Not to us, Lord, not to us” (Psalms 115:1), said Ḥananya. “To Your name give glory” (Psalms 115:1), said Mishael. “For Your kindness and for Your truth” (Psalms 115:1), said Azarya. Gabriel was answering after them: “Why should the nations say: Where [now is their God?]” (Psalms 115:2). Once this became fluent in their mouths all night, they took that as a sign and descended. (They took as a sign the fact that their prayer was fluent in their mouths. See Berakhot 34b. )   If you cannot learn it from here, learn it from another source, as it is written: “Hear now, Yehoshua the High Priest, you and your counterparts who sit before you; as they are men of a sign” (Zechariah 3:8). Who were they? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: They were Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, for whom this sign was performed. (The reference is to the sign that they received before descending into the furnace. )  If the righteous seek a sign, all the more so, the wicked [Pharaoh would]."
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 18:25:1,"AND THE LAND WAS DEFILED, THEREFORE DID I VISIT THE INIQUITY THEREOF UPON IT, AND THE LAND VOMITED OUT HER INHABITANTS. Scripture was very strict in forbidding these sexual relationships on account of the Land which becomes defiled by them, and which in turn will vomit out the people that do [these abominations]. Now forbidden sexual relationships are matters affecting personal conduct, and do not depend on the Land, [so why should the Land be affected by these personal immoral acts]? But the secret of the matter is in the verse which states, When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the borders of the people, etc. For the portion of the Eternal is His people etc. (Deuteronomy 32:8-9.)  The meaning thereof is as follows: The Glorious Name (Ibid., 28:58.)  created everything and He placed the power of the lower creatures in the higher beings, giving over each and every nation in their lands, after their nations (Genesis 10:31.)  some known star or constellation, as is known by means of astrological speculation. It is with reference to this that it is said, which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the people, (Deuteronomy 4:19.)  for He allotted to all nations constellations in the heavens, and higher above them are the angels of the Supreme One whom He placed as lords over them, as it is written, But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me, (Daniel 10:13.)  and it is written, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. (Ibid., Verse 20.)  They are called “kings,” as it is written [there], and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia. (Daniel 10:13.)  Now the Glorious Name (Ibid., 28:58.)  is G-d of gods, and Lord of lords (Deuteronomy 10:17.)  over the whole world. But the Land of Israel, which is in the middle of the inhabited earth, (Aware of the fact that the earth is spherical [and not flat, as believed by most people in the Medieval Ages], Jewish sources being mindful of this fact speak of the Land of Israel as being in the middle of the “inhabited” earth, and not just “of the earth,” as there is no middle point in a spherical body.)  is the inheritance of the Eternal designated to His Name. He has placed none of the angels as chief, observer, or ruler (Proverbs 6:7.)  over it, since He gave it as a heritage to His people who declare the Unity of His Name, the seed of His beloved ones [i.e., the patriarchs]. It is with reference to this that He said, and ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine, (Exodus 19:5.)  and it is further written, so shall ye be My people, and I will be your G-d, (Jeremiah 11:4.)  and you will not be subject to other powers at all. Now He [also] sanctified the people who dwell in His Land with the sanctity of observing the laws against forbidden sexual relationships, and with the abundant commandments, so that they [His people] would be dedicated to His Name. It is for this reason that He said, And ye shall keep all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them, that the Land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out, (Further, 20:22.)  and it is further written, But I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it’ … I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples, (Ibid., Verse 24.)  meaning to say, that He has set us apart from all the nations over whom He appointed princes and other celestial powers, by giving us the Land [of Israel] so that He, blessed be He, will be our G-d, and we will be dedicated to His Name. Thus the Land which is the inheritance of the Glorious Name, will vomit out all those who defile it and will not tolerate worshippers of idols, nor those who practise immorality. Now this section mentioned the Molech, (Above, Verse 21.)  which is a form of idolatry, together with the forbidden sexual relationships, and with reference to all of them He said, Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all of these the nations are defiled, (Verse 24.)  and the Land vomited out her inhabitants (In Verse 25 before us.)  [thus showing that the Land is unable to contain idol worshippers or those who practise immorality]. And so also did He say in the second section [i.e., in Seder Kedoshim], and I have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine, (Further, 20:26.)  which is [the basis for] the strict prohibition against idolatry. Therefore He stated that it is because they are dedicated to His Name that He gave them the Land, as it is said, And I have said unto you: ‘Ye shall inherit their Land, and I will give it unto you to possess it’ … I am the Eternal your G-d, Who have set you apart from the peoples. (Ibid., Verse 24.)  Now outside the Land of Israel, although it all belongs to the Glorious Name, (Ibid., 28:58.)  yet its purity is not perfect, because of “the servants” who hold sway there, and the nations go astray after their princes to worship them as well. It is for this reason that Scripture states, the G-d of the whole earth shall He be called, (Isaiah 54:5.)  since He is the G-d of gods Who rules over all, and He will in the end punish the host of the high heaven on high, (Ibid., 24:21.)  removing the celestial powers and demolishing the array of “the servants,” and afterwards He will punish the kings of the earth upon the earth. (Ibid., 24:21.)  This is the meaning of the verse stating, The matter is by the decree of ‘irin’ (the wakeful ones), and ‘sh’elta’ (the sentence) by the word of the holy ones, (Daniel 4:14.)  meaning, the matter that was decreed on Nebuchadnezzar [that he be driven from men and eat grass as oxen etc.] is the pronouncement of the guarding angels and the sentence of the word of the holy ones, who have ordained on the powers emanating from them that it be so. They [the angels] are called irin [literally: “the wakeful ones”], because from their emanations proceed all the powers that stir all activities, similar to that which it says, and behold ‘ir’ (a wakeful one) and a holy one came down from heaven. He cried aloud, and said thus: ‘Hew down the tree etc. (Ibid., Verse 10-11.)  — [In the verse] And ‘sh’elta’ (the sentence) is by word of the holy ones, (Daniel 4:14.)  [the word sh’elta] is like sha’alu, meaning first “they ask” what is the will of the Supreme One about it, and afterwards they decree that it be so done. It is with reference to this that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar, it is the decree of the Most High, (Ibid., Verse 21.)  for everything is from Him, blessed be He. Thus the Glorious Name, (Ibid., 28:58.)  blessed be He, is G-d of gods, (Deuteronomy 10:17.)  in the whole world, and G-d of the Land of Israel which is the inheritance of the Eternal. (I Samuel 26:19.)  This is the meaning of the expression, and he will go astray after the foreign gods of the Land, (Deuteronomy 31:16.)  for the gods are foreign to the Land of G-d and His inheritance. This is what Scripture means when it states [of the Cutheans who were settled by the king of Assyria in the cities of the kingdom of Israel], they knew not the manner of the G-d of the Land; therefore He hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land. (II Kings 17:26. The verse is thus stating that they did not live in the Land in a way befitting its special characteristic as G-d’s inheritance — hence the phrase “the G-d of the Land.”)  Now the Cutheans were not punished in their own land when they worshipped their gods, by G-d sending lions among them, but only when they came into the Land of G-d and conducted themselves as before, did He send lions among them who slew them. And so the Rabbis taught in the Sifra: (Sifra Kedoshim 11:14.)  “And the Land vomit not you out also etc. (Verse 28.)  The Land of Israel is unlike other lands; it is unable to contain sinners.” And in the Sifre we find that the Rabbis taught: (Sifre Ha’azinu, 315.)  “And there was no strange god with Him (Deuteronomy 32:12.)  [when He took Israel out of Egypt, and protected them during their wandering through the wilderness], so that none of the princes of the nations should have power to come and exercise authority over you, something like that which it is said, and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come, etc.” (Ibid., Verse 20.)  This is the meaning of the saying of the Rabbis: (Kethuboth 110 b.)  “Whoever lives outside the Land, is as if he had no G-d, for it is said, I am the Eternal your G-d, Who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d, (Further, 25:38.)  and it is further said, for they have driven me [David] out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Eternal, saying: Go, serve other gods.” (I Samuel 26:19. “And who told David, ‘Go, serve other gods?’ This can only mean to teach you that he who lives outside the Land is like etc.’” (Kethuboth). Having been forced to leave the Land, David was thus justified in saying that those responsible for it had, as it were, said to him, “Go, etc.”)  And in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah the Rabbis have said: (Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:5. On the name Tosephta, see in Seder Tazria Note 124.)  “Now it is said, And I [Jacob] will come back to my father’s house in peace, then shall the Eternal be my G-d, (Genesis 28:21.)  and it is further said, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your G-d. (Further, 25:38.)  When you are in the land of Canaan I am your G-d. When you are not in the land of Canaan, I am not your G-d if it were at all possible to say so [for He is our G-d under all circumstances and in all places]. Similarly it is said, about forty thousand ready armed for war passed on in the presence of the Eternal unto battle, (Joshua 4:13.)  and it is further said, and the Land is subdued before the Eternal, and before His people. (I Chronicles 22:18.)  But how could it enter one’s mind that Israel subdued the Land before the Eternal [as if to say that they captured it for His sake]? But [this teaches that] as long as they are upon the Land, it is as if it were subdued [before Him, since He is their G-d, as explained above], but when they are not upon it, it is not subdued.” It is on the basis of this matter that the Rabbis have said in the Sifre: (Sifre Eikev, 43.)  “And ye perish quickly from off the good Land. (Deuteronomy 11:17. The following verse continues: And ye shall lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul etc. This clearly indicates even as the Sifre teaches, that after banishment from the Land they are to continue the observance of the commandments.)  Although I banish you from the Land to outside the Land, make yourselves distinctive by the commandments, so that when you return they shall not be novelties to you. This can be compared to a master who was angry with his wife, and sent her back to her father’s house and told her, ‘Adorn yourself with precious things, so that when you come back they will not be novelties to you.’ And so did the prophet Jeremiah say [to the people in exile in Babylon], Set thee up waymarks. (Jeremiah 31:20.)  These are the commandments, by which Israel is made distinctive.” Now the verses which state, and ye perish quickly … and ye shall lay up these My words etc. (Deuteronomy 11:17-18.)  only make obligatory in the exile [the observance of those commandments] affecting personal conduct, such as the [wearing of] phylacteries and [placing of] Mezuzoth (A parchment on which is written Deuteronomy 6:4-9, and 11:13-21, and which is fastened to the right door-post. See further in Vol. II, p. 173.)  [these being specifically mentioned there in the following words of Scripture], and concerning them the Rabbis [in the above text of the Sifre] explained [that we must observe them] so that they shall not be novelties to us when we return to the Land, for the main [fulfillment] of the commandments is [to be kept] when dwelling in the Land of G-d. Therefore the Rabbis have said in the Sifre: (Sifre R’eih, 80.)  “And ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. And ye shall observe to do all the statutes etc. (Deuteronomy 11:31-32.)  Dwelling in the Land of Israel is of equal importance to all the commandments of the Torah.” A similar statement is also found in the Tosephta of Tractate Abodah Zarah. (Tosephta, Abodah Zarah 5:3.)  This in fact was the thought of the wicked ones who [misusing the intention of the above statement], said to the prophet Ezekiel [whose prophetic activity was in the Babylonian exile]: (Sanhedrin 105 a.)  “Our master Ezekiel, if a servant is sold by his master, does the master still have any claim to him?” (In other words, “since G-d sold them to Nebuchadnezzar and banished them from before Him, does He still have any claim upon them?” (Rashi ibid.). The answer was that they were never “sold” since the exile was merely a form of temporary punishment for their sins, and therefore, and that which cometh into your mind etc. (see text).)  For it is said, and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all; in that ye say: We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. (Ezekiel 20:32.)  And this was the command of our patriarch Jacob to his household, and to all that were with him, at the time that they came into the Land, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves. (Genesis 35:2.)  And G-d, by Whom alone actions are weighed, (See I Samuel 2:3.)  [brought it about] that Rachel died on the way when they started coming into the Land, (Genesis 35:16-19. See in Vol. I, pp. 330-332, where Ramban refers briefly to this problem, namely why Jacob married two sisters in their lifetime, and then concludes that “he married them only outside the Land.” Here Ramban completes the thought, by explaining that G-d, by Whom events are decided, therefore brought about the death of one of the sisters as soon as they came into the Land. The reason why Rachel had to die and not Leah, is explained in the text.)  for on account of her own merit she did not die outside the Land, and for Jacob’s merit, he could not dwell in the Land with two sisters [in their lifetime, since this is forbidden in the Torah, and the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors in the Land of Israel even before the Torah was given on Sinai], and she [Rachel] was the one by whose marriage the prohibition against two sisters took effect [since Jacob was already married to Leah]. It would appear that Rachel became pregnant with Benjamin before they came to Shechem, and while in the Land Jacob did not touch her at all, for the reason that we have mentioned. And the prophet states, And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have profaned My Land; they have filled Mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations. (Jeremiah 16:18.)  This matter [i.e., that the Land of Israel is the inheritance of the Eternal and thus cannot tolerate sinners] is found in many places in the Scriptures, and you will see it clearly after I have opened your eyes to it. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented in the section of Vayeilech: (Deuteronomy 31:16.)  “We know that G-d is One, and changes arise because of those who receive [His beneficent deeds], but G-d does not change His deeds, as they are all done in wisdom. And included in the worship of G-d is to guard the ability to receive [His beneficence] according to the place [so that if a particular place is holier than others, one must observe there more strictly the laws of holiness]. Therefore it is written [of the Cutheans, that they did not know] the manner of the G-d of the Land, (II Kings 17:26. The Cutheans were thus punished for not being heedful of the holiness of the Land of Israel which is unable to retain worshippers of idols.)  and of Jacob it is said [when he came into the Land he told his household], put away the strange gods, (Genesis 35:2.)  and the extreme opposite of [the sanctity of] the place [i.e., the Land of Israel] is indulging in forbidden sexual relationships, as they are [sins of the] flesh. The student versed [in the mysteries of the Torah] will understand.” Thus are the words [of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra] of blessed memory. Now do not refute me [in what I have written above, that Israel is under the direct guidance of G-d alone, and no celestial power determines their fate], by citing the verse, Michael your prince, (Daniel 10:21.)  for he is only a ministering angel who implores mercy for Israel, but is in no way a prince exercising any royalty or power. So was also the captain of the host (Joshua 5:14.)  who appeared to Joshua at Jericho, showing him that G-d had sent him to fight their battles, similar to [that which happened in the days of] Hezekiah. (II Kings 19:35: And it came to pass at that night, that the angel of the Eternal went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians etc.)  Besides, this matter [of Michael imploring mercy for Israel] was when we were already outside the Land of Israel. Now I do not have permission to explain on the subject of ha’aretz (“the earth” or “the Land”) more than this. (Ramban is alluding to the word ha’aretz, which is mentioned here repeatedly: vatitma ha’aretz … vataki ha’aretz (literally: “and the earth was defiled … and the earth vomited out”). This hints at the first ha’aretz, mentioned in the first verse of Creation, which Ramban has already explained in many places as referring to “the higher earth,” to which the souls finally return after their sojourn on the lower earth.)  But if you will merit to understand the first “earth” mentioned in the verse of Bereshith (In the beginning G-d created the heaven and the earth), and also the one mentioned in the section of Im Bechukothai, (Further, 26:42. v’ha’aretz ezkor (literally: “and the earth I will remember”).)  you will know a profound and sublime secret, and you will further understand what our Rabbis have said: (Tanchuma, Vayakheil 7.)  “The Sanctuary on high is exactly opposite the Sanctuary below.” I have already alluded to this on the verse, for all the earth is Mine. (Exodus 19:5.)  Now Scripture mentions that the people of the land of Canaan were punished on account of their immoral [sexual] deeds. And our Rabbis have said that they were warned about these matters from the time of creation, when these laws were declared to Adam (Sanhedrin 56 b. Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Melachim 9:1, puts it as follows: “The first man was commanded concerning six matters: idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, incest, robbery, etc.”)  and to Noah, (Incest is counted among the Seven Laws of the Noachides (see Vol. I, p. 417, Note 148).)  for He does not punish unless He admonishes first. Scripture, however, did not state the admonition, but instead said that the Land would vomit them out, for the Land abhors all these abominations. (Verse 27.)  Now the Canaanites were not the only ones who were admonished about these matters [for since these laws were declared to Adam and Noah, they applied to all mankind], and the Scriptural section mentions specifically, After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do, (Above, Verse 3.)  which proves that the Egyptians also did all these abominations, and yet the land of Egypt did not vomit them out, nor did the lands of other nations vomit them out! Rather, this whole subject shows the distinction of the Land [of Israel] and its holiness [so that it alone is unable to retain sinners]. Scripture states, and the Land vomited out [using a past tense, although the Canaanites were still living there], for from the time that He was to punish [them] for the sins committed upon her [i.e. the Land], having decreed destruction upon the Canaanites, it is as if the Land had already vomited them out. Or it may be that the expression, and the Land vomited out is a reference to above, similar to what is said, their defense is removed from over them. (Numbers 14:9. See Ramban there.) "
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Numbers 35:14:1,"YE SHALL GIVE THREE CITIES BEYOND THE JORDAN. “And even though in the land of Canaan there were nine tribes, and here [on the east side of the Jordan] there were only two [and a half], Scripture gave them an equal number of cities of refuge, because in Gilead [on the east side of the Jordan] murderers were numerous, as it is written, Gilead is a city of wrong-doers; it is covered with footprints of blood.” (Hosea 6:8.)  This is Rashi’s language, based on the words of our Rabbis. (Makkoth 10a.)  Now even though the [cities of] refuge were only for those who killed in error [and these murderers of Gilead killed deliberately], they would kill in treachery and make themselves appear as if they had done it in error, and therefore it was necessary to increase [proportionately] the number of their cities of refuge, in order to be able to take in all of them, since one could not tell who had killed deliberately. If so, [we must say that] the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded this on account of the future [since He knew that murderers in Gilead would be numerous], similar to that which it says [of the future generations], and this people will rise up, and go astray. (Deuteronomy 31:16.)  Or perhaps the Rabbis will say that the climate of the land of Gilead was conducive to producing murderers since it became a nation. (Exodus 9:24.)  But I wonder! For in the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, (Makkoth 10a.)  the [cities mentioned in the] verse which says, and beside them [i.e., apart from the six cities of refuge], ye shall give [to the Levites] forty and two cities, (Above, Verse 6.)  were all commanded as cities of refuge, and thus there were thirty-six of them in the land of Canaan, and six beyond the Jordan, (Since from the total of thirty-eight cities which, as clearly stated in Joshua Chapter 21 (see Note 68), were in the land of Canaan, we must now deduct the three main cities of refuge, leaving us a total of thirty-five additional cities of the Levites in the land of Canaan – and consequently a total of seven such additional cities for beyond the Jordan to complete the total of forty-two — we must perforce understand Ramban’s language in speaking of thirty-six cities for the land of Canaan and six for beyond the Jordan as based on the theory mentioned above in the text that the factor of appraised value was also taken into consideration, and hence the seven cities on the eastern side of the Jordan were regarded as six, thus leaving a total of thirty-six for the land of Canaan.)  and they all offered protection, in the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory! Thus the cities of refuge throughout the Land of Israel were [distributed] justly and equally, for each of the [twelve] tribes received four cities of refuge. He also counted the tribe of Menasheh in the land of Canaan, (I.e., in Joshua Chapter 21, Verse 25, the half-tribe of Menasheh in the land of Canaan is mentioned among the other nine tribes as giving cities to the Levites, which served as cities of refuge. This was because, as the text continues, the larger part of the tribe was there; therefore, although their land was smaller, the number of cities they gave to the Levites equalled that of their brethren beyond the Jordan [each giving two cities]. This proves that the determining factor was not because in Gilead murderers were numerous and that therefore the two and a half tribes beyond the Jordan were given a larger proportion of cities of refuge.)  because the majority of it was there [thus the nine tribes in the land of Canaan together with Menasheh were given thirty-six cities of refuge, i.e., those which constituted the cities of the Levites, plus the original three cities of refuge, making a total of thirty-nine]. Perhaps in [the proportion of] the [six] appointed cities (Joshua 20:9. The phrase refers to the six cities that were originally designated specifically as places of refuge. According to the Rabbis, these six cities offered protection whether the murderer knew that they were cities of refuge or not; in the other forty-two cities he was protected only if he knew that they offered protection (Makkoth 10a).)  G-d increased [the number of these cities] beyond the Jordan, in honor of Moses, so that he would set aside half of that number [since he could not enter the land of Canaan], but in their totality [of forty-eight cities] they were all divided up by measure and according to proportion [each tribe receiving four cities]. According to the simple meaning of Scripture, it appears to me that the land on the [east] side of the Jordan was very large, for it contained [the kingdom of] the two great Amorite kings [Sihon and Og], about whose might the verses speak in superlative terms, and [this kingdom became] even greater when Ammon and Moab became a legitimate [conquest for Israel] through them [i.e., through Sihon and Og who captured the lands of Ammon and Moab, and from whom Israel subsequently took them by the right of conquest], (Chullin 60b. Israel was not allowed to fight against Ammon and Moab (see Deuteronomy 2:19). But since parts of their lands were captured by Sihon first, this injunction was removed.)  whereas the kings of the land of Canaan were merely kings of cities, and every ruler of a city was called a “king,” as you see [from the verse]: the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one, (Joshua 12:10. See also ibid., Verses 9 and 16.)  although between them [these two cities] there is a distance of [only] half a day’s walk. (This language possibly indicates that Ramban wrote this on the basis of his personal experience, which would indicate that these parts of his commentary were written [or emended] when he was already living in the Land of Israel. See my article on this issue in Hamayon, Tammuz, 5728.)  Similarly the Sages mention (Shemoth Rabbah 32:2.)  that between Beth-el and Ai is a distance of [only] four miles, and yet each of these cities had its own king. (Joshua 12:10. See also ibid., Verses 9 and 16.)  It is possible that it was the custom in those generations to call every ruler of a city “king,” or perhaps [this was only in the Land of Israel] in honor of the Land of Israel, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, explained. (Bereshith Rabbah 85:16: “Any king or ruler who had no [seat of] sovereignty in the Land of Israel would consider himself worthless.”)  In any case, they were not kings of countries, but only kings of particular cities. And thus it is written, [And Adoni-bezek said], ‘Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my table.’ (Judges 1:7. The seventy kings subject to Adoni-bezek were clearly not kings of countries, but of small local areas.)  Thus the land on the [east] side of the Jordan was a very large land, and required three cities of refuge just as the whole of the Land of Israel on the [west] side of the Jordan did, and only these six cities offered refuge [to unwitting murderers], and the forty-two cities [set aside] were for the open lands of the Levites and not for refuge. (Ramban is here explaining the verses “according to their simple meaning,” and not according to the opinion of the Rabbis, as mentioned above (at Note 82). See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 338, for further explanation.) "
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 14:18:1,"ומלכי צדק מלך שלם, the word שלם is another word for ירושלים, and we find it referred to as such in Psalms 76,3 ויהי בשלם סכו, “Salem became His abode.” It was customary to give the title Malki Tzedek or Adoni Tzedek, to kings of Jerusalem in those days, just as the kings of Egypt were called Pharaoh. Compare Joshua 10,1 where we find אדני צדק מלך ירושלים. Jerusalem traditionally represented the center of righteousness and peace. It is a place in which iniquity is less tolerated than anywhere else. This is why the Torah warned in Leviticus 18,28 that the Israelites should take care that the land not spew them out just as it had spewed out previous inhabitants because they had defiled it. The reason the Torah in Deuteronomy 31,16 uses the somewhat enigmatic expression אלוהי נכר הארץ, is that the kind of conduct by the people in that city that were spewed out, was a conduct that was irreconcilable (alien) with the very nature, spiritual climate, prevailing in, and being part of that holy city. The sons of Korach already recognised and extolled this spiritual climate of the very city when they said in Psalms 48,3 יפה נוף משוש כל הארץ הר ציון ירכתי צפון קרית מלך רב, “fair-crested, joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, summit of Tzafon, city of the great King.” In the Midrash quoted by Rashi, Malki Tzedek is identified as Shem, the son of Noach."
31,16,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Sanhedrin 11:3","GEMARA: Why such a punishment [to him who says that the resurrection is not intimated in the Torah]? It was taught in a Baraitha: He denied resurrection, therefore as punishment he will not have a share in it; for all retributions of the Holy One, praised be He! are commensurate with man's doings."" And R. Samuel b. Nachmeni said in the name of R. Jochanan: ""Whence do we know that all the retributions of the Holy One, praised be He! are commensurate with man's doings?' It is said (II Kings 7, 1-2) Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus hath said the Lord, About this time tomorrow a s'ah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two s'ahs of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said, Behold, will the Lord make windows in heaven, that this thing shall be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thereof shalt thou not eat. (Ib. b) And further it is written, And it happened unto him so; for the people trod him down in the gate and he died."" But perhaps this was because Elisha cursed him? As R. Juda, in the name of Rab, said: ""If a sage curses anyone, even for no cause, it nevertheless comes to pass?"" If this were the cause, it should read: And the people trod on him and he died. Why ""in the gate""? Because of [his protest which he made at] the gate. R. Jochanan said: ""Where is the resurrection of the dead intimated in the Torah?"" It is said (Num. 18, 28) And ye shall give thereof the heave-offering (T'rumah) of the Lord to Aaron the priest. Would then Aaron remain alive forever that Israel should give him heave-offerings? Infer from this that he will come to life again and Israel will give him heave-offerings. Hence here is an intimation in the Torah of the resurrection. The school of R. Ismael, however, explained the above passage in this manner: 'To Aaron,' means priests who are similar to him — viz., scholars as he was. And from this it is inferred that no T'rumah should be given to an ignorant priest. R. Samuel b. Nachmeni said: ""Whence do we know that one must not give the heaveoffering to a priest who is an ignoramus? It is said (I Chron. 31, 4) To give the portion of the priests, and the Levites, in order that they might hold firmly to the law of the Lord. Hence the priest who knows how to hold firmly to the law has a portion, but not he who is ignorant of the law."" R. Acha b. Ada said in the name of R. Juda: ""Whoever gives T'rumah to an ignorant priest acts as if he threw it before a lion; just as in throwing it before a lion there is a doubt whether it shall be trodden upon and eaten or not, so is it doubtful whether the priest will eat it in Levitical cleanliness or uncleanliness."" R. Jochanan said: ""He may even cause death to the ignorant priest [by doing so] as it is said (Lev. 22, 9) That they may not bear sin through it, and die therefor, if they profane it."" At the college of R. Eliezer b. Jacob it was taught that (Ib. ib. 16) also applies to him who gives heaveoffering to an ignoramus. There is a Baraitha: R. Simi said: ""Whence is the Biblical intimation of the resurrection of the dead? It is said (Ex. 6, 4) And as I did also establish my covenant with them, to give unto them the land of Canaan."" It does not read to you (lachem), but (lahem) to them — hence this is an intimation of the resurrection. The Sadducees questioned Rabban Gamaliel: ""Whence do you infer that the Holy One, praised be He! would restore the dead to life?"" And he answered: ""From the Pentateuch, Prophets, and Hagiographa."" However, they did not accept it. From the Pentateuch, — it is written (Deut. 31, 16) And the Lord said unto Moses, Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers (v-kam) and arise. And they answered: ""Perhaps the word v-kam is connected with its succeeding words, and the people will go astray."" From the Prophets, — it is written (Is. 26, 19) Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for a dew on herbs is thy dew, and the earth shall cast out the departed. [They also rejected this explanation, saying] ""Perhaps this refers to those dead who were revivified by Ezekiel (Ez. 36)."" From the Hagiographa: — It is written, (Son. 7, 10) And thy palate like the best wine, that glided down for my friend, gently exciting the lips of those that are asleep. And they answered: ""Perhaps only their lips moved [in the graves], as R. Jochanan said; for R. Jochanan said in the name of R. Simon b. Jehozadak: ""Whoever reports a traditional law in the name of its author, [causes] his [the author's] lips to move in the grave, as it is said, Exciting the lips of those that are asleep."" Thereafter, when Rabban Gamaliel mentioned to them (Deut. 11, 9) And the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers to give unto them, which does not read to you, but to them — hence it is an intimation for resurrection from the Torah — his explanation was accepted. According to others, he inferred from this passage (Deut. 4, 4) But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day, i.e., just as this day you are all alive, so also will you be alive in the world to come. The Romans questioned R. Joshua b. Chananiah: ""Whence do you know that the Holy One, praised be He! will restore the dead to life and that it is revealed before Him all that will happen in the future?"" And he answered: ""Both things are inferred from the following passage (Deut. 31, 16) And the Lord said unto Moses, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers (v'kam) and arise."" ""Perhaps the word v'kam belongs to its succeeding words, And the people will go astray?"" He rejoined: ""Accept at least the explanation of the [half] of your question, that it is revealed before Him all that will happen in the future."" The same was taught also by R. Jochanan in the name of R. Simon b. Jochai: ""Whence do we infer that the Holy One, praised be He! will restore the dead to life and that it is revealed before Him all that will happen in the future? It is said, Thou shalt sleep with thy parents and (v'kam) arise."""
31,16,Jewish Thought,Shemonah Kevatzim 3:24:1,"“I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1). The inner, essential “I” – whether of the individual or of the community – appears within [an entity] only in relation to its holiness and purity [and] in relation to the degree of its supernal power suffused by the pure light of an elevated illumination, flaming  within it. “We and our forefathers sinned” (Psalms 106:6). Adam sinned. He was alienated from his essence. He turned to the consciousness of the serpent and lost himself. He did not know how to give a clear answer to the question, “Where are you?” (Genesis 3:9), because he did not know himself, because he had lost [his] true “I,” with [his] sin of bowing to a strange god. [The nation of] Israel sinned. It “ran after foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It abandoned its essential “I.” “Israel rejected goodness” (Hosea 8:3). The earth sinned [during the week of Creation]. It denied its essence. It constricted its power. It went after [limited] goals and purposes. It did not give forth all of its hidden power so that the taste of the tree would be equal to the taste of its fruit (Sukkah 35a). It raised its eyes to look outside of itself, to think about [its trivial] future, its “career.” The moon complained [at that time] (Hullin 60b). [As a result,] it lost its internal orbit, the joy of its portion. It was dreaming of a superficial beauty of royalty. Thus does the world continue to sink, with the loss of the “I” of every [entity] – of the individual and of the whole. Learned educators come and focus on the superficial. They too remove their consciousness from the “I.” They add straw to the fire, give vinegar to the thirsty, and fatten minds and hearts with everything that is external to them. And the “I” grows progressively forgotten. And when there is no “I,” there is no “He,” and how much more is there no “You.” The Messiah is called “the breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of God” (Lamentations 4:20). This is his might, the beauty of his greatness: [that] he is not outside of us. He is the breath of our nostrils. Let us seek Hashem our God and David our king. Let us tremble before God and His goodness. Let us seek our “I.” Let us seek ourselves – and find. Remove all foreign gods, remove every stranger and illegitimate one. Then “you will know that I am Hashem your God, Who takes you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Hashem your God” (cf. Numbers 15:41)."

Nachmanides writes, that of course, the Torah does not suggest that these gods have any legitimacy in any other country either, but the Torah stresses that in that land they have even less claim to legitimacy, seeing that only the G’d of Israel has any claim to that, especially in the Israelites’ land. These so-called gods are not even familiar with the customs and mores that govern human conduct in that land. (Compare Kings II 7,26)

31,16,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 305:6,"When Moses died, Joshua cried and screamed and mourned for him many days, until the Holy One Blessed be He said to him: Joshua, how long will you mourn him?

(Isaiah 22:12) ""And the L-rd G-d called for crying and lamenting, etc."" And, what is more, he is assured of life in the world to come, viz.

31,16,Quoting Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Leviticus 18:18:1,"TO BE A RIVAL. Li-tzeror (to be a rival) is related to the word tzaratah (her rival) in And her rival vexed her (I Sam. 1:6). Note, Scripture does not mention in the Torah portion Ye shall be holy (Lev. 19:2) (The Torah portion Ye shall be holy lists those with whom one is not permitted to have sexual intercourse and the punishment for violating these prohibitions.)  the punishment for sleeping with two sisters, and it does not mention the punishment for sleeping with the daughter of one’s son and with the daughter of one’s daughter. (I.E. notes this. However, he does not explain why.)  The one who says that Rachel and Leah (Two sisters whom Jacob married.)  were not sisters (Hence Jacob was permitted to marry them.)  errs. His proof is, for all these abominations… (Lev. 18:27). (Marrying two sisters is thus an abomination. Jacob would not commit an abominable act.)  However, this is not a rigorous proof. There are those who answer the one who asks, how could God punish for something He did not warn against, (Verses 27 and 28 tells us that the Canaanites were punished for practicing the sexual acts that the Torah prohibits. Hence the question arose from the anonymous commentator quoted by I.E.)  by saying the sons of Noah were warned about these sexual offenses. Others say (In reply to the problem raised by Jacob marrying two sisters.)  that even though Scripture makes a general statement, for all these abominations…, the reference is not to all these abominations but to most of them. (The phrase does not include two sisters. Thus marrying two sisters is not an abomination. The law prohibiting two sisters did not apply to Jacob, who lived before the Torah was given to Israel.)  You will learn my opinion (Regarding why Jacob was permitted to marry two sisters.)  in the Torah portion And Moses went (Deut. 31:1). (See I.E. on Deut. 31:16 and the notes thereto (Vol. 4, p. 227).)  "

31,16,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vaera 11:1","When Pharaoh shall speak unto you (Exod. 7:9). Scripture states (elsewhere in reference to this verse): Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying: “My counsel shall stand, and all My pleasure will I do” (Isa. 46:10). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared at the very beginning what the end would be, when He said to Moses: Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up, and go astray (Deut. 31:16). They were destined to do so upon Joshua’s death. And will forsake Me, and break My covenant (ibid.), as it is said: And they forsook the Lord, and served Him not (Judg. 10:7). Hence at the very beginning he disclosed what would follow."
31,16,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Beshalach 26:3","Choose us out. This alludes to the mighty men who are fearful of sinning. And go out. That is, leave the protection of the clouds, and fight against Amalek tomorrow. Isi the son of Judah said: There are five verses in the Torah in which there are five words whose meanings are unclear: Lifted up, Cursed, Tomorrow, Made like almonds, and Rise up. (These words may be construed with what precedes or with what follows, yielding different meanings.)  Shall it not be lifted up? might be understood as in the verse If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? (Gen. 4:7), but on the other hand, it might be understood as Shall it not be lifted up even if thou doest not well? (Gen. 4:6). Cursed might be construed as in the verse For in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they houghed [an accursed] oxen (Gen. 49:6–7), or it may be construed as in the verse Cursed be their anger (ibid., v. 7). Tomorrow might be understood as in the verse Go out and fight with Amalek tomorrow, or it might be interpreted as in the verse Tomorrow I will stand (Exod. 17:9). Made like almond blossoms might be understood as in the verse And in the candlestick four cups made like almond blossoms (Exod. 25:34), or as in the verse Like almond blossoms the knops thereof (ibid.). Rise up might be understood as in the verse Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up (Deut. 31:16) or as in the verse Sleep with thy fathers, and rise up (ibid.)."
31,16,Talmud,Sanhedrin 90b:9,"The proof from the Torah is as it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise” (Deuteronomy 31:16).

31,16,Talmud,Sanhedrin 90b:14,"The Romans asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: From where is it derived that the Holy One, Blessed be He, revives the dead, and from where is it derived that He knows what is destined to be? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said to them: Both of those matters are derived from this verse, as it is stated: “And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise; this people will go astray” (Deuteronomy 31:16). This indicates that Moses will die and then arise from the dead and that the Holy One, Blessed be He, knows what the children of Israel are destined to do."
31,16,Midrash,Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:2:6,"“…for your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2). We learned there (Mishna Avoda Zara 2:5): Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua as they were walking on the way: ‘Why did [the Sages] prohibit the cheese of the gentiles?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him: ‘Because they curdle it with the stomach contents of an animal carcass.’ He said to [Rabbi Yehoshua]: ‘But are the stomach contents of a burnt offering not more stringent than the stomach contents of an animal carcass, yet they said that a priest who is broad minded (He is not particular about what he eats.)  swallows it raw.’ What is, swallows it raw? He gulps it down. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: They rendered it like a tainted cup; he may not benefit, but he is not liable for misuse of consecrated items. (Thus, if one eats the stomach contents of a consecrated animal, one is not liable for misuse of a consecrated item. This proves that it is not considered a food item, therefore its consumption is not a normal act of eating. Similarly, the stomach contents of an unslaughtered animal carcass should not be considered a food item, and should not render the cheese non-kosher.)  [Rabbi Yishmael] said to him: (In the mishna, this is stated as a response to a second explanation given by Rabbi Yehoshua for the prohibition of eating the cheese of gentiles: They curdle it in the stomach contents of animals that have been slaughtered as an idolatrous sacrifice.)  ‘If so, why did they not prohibit benefit from it?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] diverted his attention to another matter. He said to him: ‘Yishmael, my brother, how do you read it? For Your love [dodekha] is better than wine, or your love [dodayikh] [is better] than wine?’ (Do you think that the term “your love” is stated in the masculine form [dodekha], indicating that it is being stated by the woman, representing Israel, to the man, representing God, or is it stated in the feminine form [dodayikh], indicating that it is stated by the man, representing God, to the woman, representing Israel. Rabbi Yishmael answered that it is vocalized dodayikh, in the feminine.)  He said to him: ‘The matter is not so, as its counterpart teaches in its regard: “Your oils [shemanekha] have a goodly fragrance”’ (Song of Songs 1:3). (Just as this verse is in the masculine, so, too, the previous verse, which is the verse under discussion, is also in the masculine.)  Why did he not reveal it to him? (Why did he divert his attention rather than answering his question?)  Rabbi Yonatan said: It is because they had prohibited it only recently, (When the Sages issue a decree, for the first year they do not reveal the reason behind it, so that people will accept the decree without questioning its rationale.)  and Rabbi Yishmael was young. Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta and Rabbi Ḥagai in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman [said]: It is written: “Lambs [kevasim] will be for your garments” (Proverbs 27:26). Kevashim, concealed items, is written. (The word, as written, can be read either kevasim or kevashim.)  When your students are young, conceal matters of Torah from them. When they grow and become Torah scholars, reveal the secrets of Torah to them. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [tasim] before them” (Exodus 21:1), just as this treasure [sima] is not revealed to every person, the same is true of matters of Torah. Rav Huna raised a question and Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva posed a difficulty: (Some suggest that the text should read: Rav Huna, citing Rabbi Hama bar Ukva, posed a difficulty (Etz Yosef).)  If he sought to divert him, he should have diverted him from the five verses in the Torah that require resolution. (In each of these cases there are two phrases, and it is unclear whether a particular word which appears at the border of the two belongs to the first or second phrase.)  These are they: “se’et” (Genesis 4:7); “cursed” (Genesis 49:7); (Does “cursed” belong to the previous verse: “And with their will they hamstrung an ox that is cursed” or does it belong to the beginning of this verse: “Cursed is their wrath, as it is fierce”? )  “tomorrow” (Exodus 17:9); (Is it “Go out and battle Amalek tomorrow” or is it “Tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill”?)  “crafted like almonds” (Exodus 25:34); (Is it “four cups crafted like almonds,” or is it “like almonds are its knobs and flowers”?)  “arise” (Deuteronomy 31:16). (Is it “you will lie with your ancestors and arise,” or is it “this people will arise and it will stray”?)  Is it, “if you do well you will receive forgiveness [se’et],” or is it “you will bear your sin [se’et] if you do not do well”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I have another: “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard” or “when they heard [the men were saddened] and they came from the field” (Genesis 34:7). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “And the Lord commanded me” (Deuteronomy 4:14); there are matters that He said to me myself, and there are matters that He told me to say to my children. (Some matters of Torah are meant to publicized to all, and others are meant to be communicated only to those who are worthy.)  Rabbi Eila said: There are matters that one seals [meshikin] (This is derived from yishakeni. Rabbi Yehoshua raised this verse to Rabbi Yishmael in order to allude to the fact that not everything is meant to be publicized (Matnot Kehuna).)  in one’s mouth. How so? One verse says: “I store Your saying in my heart, so as not to sin against You” (Psalms 119:11), and one verse says: “With My lips I have recounted all the ordinances of Your mouth” (Psalms 119:13). In what sense can both these verses coexist? Rather, as long as Ira HaYa’iri, David’s mentor, was alive, “I store Your saying in my heart”; when he departed, “with my lips I have recounted.” (David did not publicize halakhic matters during the lifetime of his teacher because a disciple is prohibited from issuing halakhic rulings in the presence of his teacher (Eruvin 63a).) "
31,16,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vaera 11:1","(Exod. 7:8–9:) THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU, < SAYING > PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE, . This text is related to (Is. 46:10): DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING, AND FROM OF OLD, THINGS THAT HAVE NOT  HAPPENED, SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE (HPTs). (Tanh., Exod. 2:11; Exod. R. 9:1.)  What is the meaning of DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING? The Holy One declares from the start what is going to happen in the end. Where is it shown? Where he said so to Moses (in Deut. 31:16): BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING …. He told him what Israel was going to do after Joshua had been dead for some years. (Ibid.:) AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND. And so they did (according to Jud. 2:11): THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND THEY WORSHIPPED THE BAALS…. (Deut. 31:16, cont.:) THEY WILL FORSAKE ME AND BREAK MY COVENANT. (Cf. Jud. 2:12:) THEY FORSOOK THE LORD {AND DID NOT WORSHIP HIM}. Ergo (in Is. 46:10): DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. R.

Is. 46:10, cont.:) SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE. Why so? Because the Holy One does not desire (HPTs) to convict any creature, as stated (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS (HPTs) IN WICKEDNESS…. (Tanh., Gen. 4:8; M. Pss. 5:7.)  And so it says (in Ezek. 33:11): I DO NOT DESIRE (rt.: HPTs) THE DEATH OF THE WICKED … Ergo (in Is. 46:10): SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE (HPTs). Thus the Holy One desires (HPTs) to declare all his creatures righteous, as stated (in Is. 42:21): THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED (HPTs) BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH. (On this interpretation of Is. 42:21, see also Mak. 3:16; ARN, A, 41:21; Targum to Is. 42:21.)  Ergo (in Is. 46:10): AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE."

This text is related (to Is. 46:10): DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING. When Moses arrived at passing from the world, the Holy One declared to him what Israel was going to do after the death of Joshua. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 31:16): THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND. For that reason Moses warned them (in Deut. 31:29): FOR I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL SURELY ACT CORRUPTLY. But they said to him: We will not do this thing. He said to them: You are going to beget CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN and forget the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Deut. 4:26; 30:19): I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY….

31,16,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:16:1-2","הנך שוכב עם אבותיך, “here you are going to lie with your fathers, etc.” When Moses had complained that G’d was using the very instrument to kill him with which he had used to praise the Lord with, G’d reassured him, calmed him down by assuring him that as opposed to other people who die and whose influence dies with them, his influence would continue to be manifest just as the sun’s influence is manifest even after it sets when it shines upon the moon enabling the moon to illuminate the earth with its reflected light. The verse is used to prove that resurrection is promised in the Torah as the sages in Sanhedrin 90 read the sequence of the words הנך שוכב עם אבותיך וקם as if G’d were saying: “here you will lie with your fathers and arise.” Similar comments are made about Moses having introduced the famous song after the crossing of the Sea of Reeds with the words אש ישיר instead of אז שר, “then he will sing,” instead of “then he sang” (Exodus 15,1). Concerning the serenity experienced by the souls in the hereafter the sages in Avot 4,22 opined that a single hour of the serenity in that world outweighs all the good experienced in our terrestrial world. If G’d, as it were, introduced Moses to that world of serenity with the word הן, He did indeed set Moses’ mind at rest over the need for him to leave the arena in which he had been so influential. He convinced him that death is the entrance fee one has to pay for attaining that desirable serenity. Considering all this, Moses had no reason to view death as a penalty, on the contrary, he was to view it as an introduction to untold delights. All of this is alluded to in the otherwise extraneous letter ך at the end of the word הנך, seeing Moses had not been accurate (according to the Midrash) in comparing הן and הנך. This final letter was an allusion to the כסא הכבוד, “G’d’s throne of glory in the celestial regions,” the proximity of which Moses would henceforth experience. We have previously mentioned that the inexplicable use of that letter such as in Leviticus chapter 27,2 בערכך נפשות לה', is also an allusion to that כסא הכבוד. All the souls which truly belong to Hashem, לה', are to be found in that celestial region, i.e. are viewed as close to the throne of G’d’s glory in value.  From all of the foregoing you will realise that although G’d introduced Moses’ impending death to him with the word הן, Moses was not correct in complaining that the very instrument he had used to praise the Lord with was now being turned against him.  The fact that the word הן, as distinct from the word הנה, is a plural, indicates that G’d referred to two kinds of life after death which Moses would attain. The first is the life reserved for the souls while they await the metamorphosis of our universe in the seventh millennium, as we discussed repeatedly; the second is the physical life after the resurrection. Whereas the word הנך may allude to the life of the souls, the words שוכב וקם, “lie down and arise,” are an allusion to this life after the period of the resurrection when both body and soul are reunited."
31,16,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:16:3","אלהי נכר הארץ, “after the gods of the foreigners of the land.” The Torah tells us that such gods as had been permitted to the Gentile nations were nonetheless “strangers” in the Holy Land as that land was always under the direct supervision of the Lord, and He had never assigned what goes on there to the supervision of any celestial/planetary forces. This land is G’d’s own “inheritance.” This is also what the sages meant when they said אין מזל לישראל, “the Jewish people are not subject to the horoscopic influences we know as mazal.” They meant that the Jewish people, when in the land of Israel and observing the laws of the Torah, are not subject to such influences. This must be so, as we have a clear statement by these same sages that מזלו גורם, that “his mazal was a causative factor in his fate.” (Yevamot 64, et al) Seeing that the planets, stars, and all other celestial phenomena have been created for the sake of the righteous, how could it possibly be that these same righteous people are suddenly subject to these horoscopic constellations? Each of these horoscopic constellations has been assigned to certain nations, such as the constellation known as scorpion which was assigned to the people of Ishmael, the constellation Sagittarius, the archer, to the people of Persia, etc., etc. This was what the Torah referred to in Deut. 4,19-20 “which He assigned to them, whereas He (personally) took you out of the iron crucible, etc.” Clearly, the supervision of the fates of the other nations by celestial forces has been entrusted to agents of the Lord, i.e. the horoscopic forces, whereas that of the Jewish people is not determined by means of intermediaries. It is noteworthy that nowhere in the Torah does G’d accuse the Gentile nations of idolatry or describe them as being punished for relating to these forces as gods. Only the Jewish people have been warned again and again not to turn to any form of intermediary, and they are being held responsible for observing this commandment in the strictest possible sense. The only time Gentile nations are described as being punished for the practice of idolatry is if they did so in the Holy Land, the land which G’d claimed as His share and inheritance. The best proof of this is found in Kings II 17,26 where the prophet tells us about the Kushites who practiced the cults of their fathers after they had been forcibly transplanted to the areas previously inhabited by the Ten Tribes who had been exiled by King Shalmanesser of Assyria.  The reason that the Torah speaks here of אלוהי נכר הארץ, is that these deities are totally alien to the land of Israel, fulfilling neither a function for the local inhabitants nor for the Israelites. All kinds of idolatry is alien to that country, no intermediary force having been assigned to function in that land. Anyone practicing idolatry in that land is seen as if he were trying to expel the king of that country from his palace. This is one of the ways in which the land of Israel is superior to all other countries. This fact is alluded to in the verse in Job 5,10: הנותן מטר על פני ארץ ושולח מים על פני חוצות, “Who gives rain to the earth, and sends water over the fields.” This verse teaches that G’d’s benevolent supervision of what goes on earth concentrates on the land of Israel and spreads from there to other parts of the globe. These parts are referred to in the verse in Job as חוצות, “outlying areas.” The manner in which this proliferation has been described is שולח, “dispatches,” whereas the rain which falls in the Holy Land is described in this verses as the result of נתינה, “something given directly.” David refers to the areas described as חוצות in Job as אהלי רשע, “the tents of the wicked.” (Psalms 84,11) The whole verse there reads: “Better one day in Your courts than a thousand anywhere else; I would rather stand on the threshold of G’d’s House than dwell in the tents of wickedness.” When compared to Jerusalem, the city of righteousness, other locations do not qualify for a better description than “tents of wickedness.” Our paragraph refers to the period of the first Temple when idolatry was rampant."
31,16,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:16:4","אשר הוא בא שמה בקרבו, “in whose midst it is coming.” the reference is not to the people but to the land. This is not the first time that the word ארץ appears as masculine; we have a similar masculine description of the land of Israel in Genesis 13,6.  It is also possible that the word בקרבו is an allusion to the Sanctuary in the land, which is viewed as being in its center. This would be analogous to a statement by our sages in Petichta Rabbah to Lamentations 22: “How long (did they relentlessly introduce more and more idolatry)? Until they introduced idolatry into the Sanctuary itself.” [The Midrash refers to a verse in Jeremiah 11,6 in which the proliferation of idolatry in the towns of Yehudah is described and the word חוצות describes the innermost part of Jerusalem. It adds a verse from Ezekiel 8,5 describing penetration by idolatry of the Sanctuary itself as the ultimate act of rebellion against the Lord. Ed.]"
31,16,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:16:1","The [non-Jewish] nations of the land: [Rashi writes this] so that you should not explain [erroneously] that the word neichar [foreign] refers to their gods. Rather It is as if it said the gods of the foreigners of the land. For if you say that it means foreign gods, it should have said to foreign gods. For we never find the word gods [elohei] modified [i.e., connected] by the word which follows it. The proof-text for this is God of Avraham [Elohei Avraham], etc. (Bereishis 31:42) which means God of Avraham, and the word god is not connected to the word which follows it. Furthermore, if the word gods' was modified by the word foreign it would not have used the phrase of the land. [I found this in the name of Maharitz]. If you ask, what is the reason that the nations of the land are called the strangers of the land,” one can answer that they are considered foreigners in that land, because the land was not theirs, for it had already been decreed that they would be expelled from there. "
31,16,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:16:2,"Another meaning of the verse is that not only the generation Moses describes in our verse will worship idols but also the following generation. We find in Judges 2,11 that after the death of Joshua and his generation, the Israelites began to worship the Baal. This is what G'd had predicted in our verse when He said to Moses that after he would die this people would rise and stray after alien gods."
31,16,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, V'Zot HaBerachah 7:1","(Deut. 31:14:) “Behold (hn) the days are drawing near for you [to die].” Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, with the word that I [used to] praise (Cf. Gk.: kalos.)  You when I said (in Deut. 10:14), ‘Behold (hn) the heavens [and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all that is in it] belong to the Lord your God’; by that [very word] (i.e., hn) you have condemned me to death?” (Above, Deut. 2:6.)  The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I am bringing you peace of mind, (as in Deut. 31:16), ‘Behold (hn-) you (-k) are [soon] to sleep with your ancestors….’” R. Abbahu said, “The words, behold you (hnk), can only mean peace of mind, since it is stated (in Job 3:17), ‘there (in death) the weary are at rest (yanuhu, understood to have the root hnk).’” (Cf. Gen. R. 9:5.)  (Deut. 31:14, literally:) “Behold your days are drawing near [to die].” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “A drawing near is uttered with reference to the forefathers, and a drawing near is uttered with reference to the kings (in I Kings 2:1), ‘Then when the days for David to die drew near.’ With reference to the prophets (there is Moses, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, addresses in the second person in Deut. 31:14), ‘Behold your days are drawing near [to die].’” R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10), ‘In whose hand is every living soul.’ If the living are delivered into His hand, are the dead not delivered into His hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living. (Ber. 18ab.)  Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20), ‘And Benaiah ben Jehoiada, the son of a valiant warrior (literally, of a living person) from Kazbeel, [who had performed great deeds…].’ And is not everyone [eventually] dead? However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30), ‘And you, O slain wicked [prince of Israel, whose day has come…].’” And so it says (in Deut. 17:6), “On the evidence of two or three witnesses shall the dead be put to death.” Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. Because on seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, ""blessed be the One who forms light."" (The opening blessing before the morning Shema‘.)  When it sets, he does not say the blessing, ""who brings on evenings."" (The opening blessing before the evening Shema‘.)  Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every thing that they eat and drink, and see and hear. Moreover, [these blessings] are uttered not only while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5-6), “Let the saints rejoice in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds. With paeans to God in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands.”"
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on II Chronicles 21:11:1,"and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray - Heb. זְנוּת. It is appropriate to use the term harlotry in connection with anyone who forsakes and exchanges the fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, for the idolatry of star and planet worship - for such a person behaves in the manner of a promiscuous woman who commits adultery with others, and similar to this are (Deut. 31:16): “and this people will rise and go astray (וְזָנָה) after the foreign gods of the land”; (Hos. 1:2): “for the land will go astray (זָנה תִזְנֶה), etc.”"
31,16,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 32:43:3","וכפר אדמתו עמו, “and He will appease His land and His people.” According to both Onkelos, Ibn Ezra, and Rashi, the words אדמתו עמו are to be understood as אדמתו ועמו, “His land and His people.”  The Midrash (Sifri on our verse) understands the words as if the Torah had written וכפר אדמתו על עמו, “its land will be atonement for its people.”  According to Ketuvot 111 the meaning is that if a Jew is buried in the land of Israel, his sins will be transferred to the soil, i.e. the land of Israel will act as a Mikveh, a ritual bath, cleansing him from his impurities. The wording there is “that being buried in the land of Israel is equivalent to being buried beneath the Holy Altar.” This is an extension of the verse “You shall build an altar of earth for me” (Exodus 20,24). This is also understood to be the meaning of the sages’ comment that the reason G’d created Adam out of earth was that the place which would serve as the means of his atonement was his origin. [by making him out of earth, G’d facilitated his eventual atonement when he would return to earth. Ed.] This is the advantage of ארץ ישראל, that it is the palace of the King (G’d) and therefore is also known as ארץ ה', (Joshua 22,19). It is also known as נחלת ה', “the Lord’s heritage.” Anything outside the boundaries of the land of Israel is always referred to as something “outside, external.” The Scriptures refer to such countries as חוצות, (compare Proverbs 8,26 where the word ארץ and חוצות appear side by side to make this distinction and is even called אהלי רשע “tents of the wicked,” in Psalms 84,11).   In the parlance of our sages in Gittin 8, any land outside the land of Israel is referred to as ארץ העמים. To make the distinction crystal clear, the sages decreed ritual impurity on any produce imported from these countries and even its airspace was considered as ritually impure, so that by having traversed it one needs to purify oneself. The only exception to this ruling was Syria because it adjoins the land of Israel. I have already mentioned this in connection with 31,16 אלוהי נכר הארץ."

The section of ‘the judges’ (Ex. 18, 21-23.)  would have been worthy to be promulgated even if Jethro had not arisen. The section of ‘the smaller Passover’ (Num. 9, 1-14, also known as the ‘second Passover’.)  would have been worthy to be promulgated even if the ‘unclean’ had not arisen, as it is stated, We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the Lord in its appointed season among the children of Israel?

(Gen. 15, 13.)  Israel were destined to serve idols even if Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had not arisen, as it is stated, And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land.

Israel would have been destined to be destroyed by the sword even if so and so (i.e. nations hostile to Israel. They were so many that they are not specified.)  had not arisen, as it is stated, All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword; (Amos.Cf. IX, 10.)  and it declares, By sword and famine shall they be consumed. (Jer. 14, 15.)  Israel would have deserved to be destroyed even if Nebuchadnezzar and his companions had not arisen, as it is stated, Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

This verse shows that, although the word aretz (land) is feminine, Scripture sometimes uses it as the subject of a masculine verb, as in this verse, where the verb nasa (able to bear) is used in connection with ha’aretz instead of the feminine verb nasah. Here, too, b’kirbo [literally: “in the midst of him”] is used with reference to “the Land” instead of the feminine b’kirboh.)  the land burnt up, (Isaiah 9:18.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,16,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:16:1","V. 16. וקם .ויאמר וגו׳: es wird dies nicht heimlich, als etwas zu Scheuendes tun. Es wird darin etwas ganz Berechtigtes finden, das man mit vollem Selbstgefühl in aufgerichteter Haltung üben mag. נכר .אחרי אלהי נכר הארץ (siehe zu Bereschit 35, 2). Sie betrachten die von der palästinensischen Bevölkerung verehrten Gottheiten als zu dem Lande gehörig, als solche, deren Verehrung kein im Lande Wohnender vernachlässigen dürfe, wenn er darin Schutz und Gedeihen finden wolle. In Wahrheit ist es aber ein Unwesen, das dem Lande als jüdisches Land, als Land des Gottesgesetzes fremd bleiben sollte. בקרבו, da ארץ in der Regel weiblich ist, kann sich בקרבו nur auf נכר beziehen. Es meint, in dem Lande, wohin es gekommen, befinde es sich in der Mitte eines lokalen Götterregimes. Daher neigt es sich, zuerst ohne förmlich den Bund mit Gott zu brechen, diesem Götterunwesen zu und bringt Gott seine Opfer im Heiligtum, erfüllt auch noch wohl Vorschriften seines Gesetzes, dient aber zugleich den Landesgöttern auf den Höhen. In Wahrheit aber ועזבני, verlässt es damit Gott, והפר את בריתי und bricht endlich den Bund mit dem Gesetze, zu welchem es sein Bund mit Gott verpflichtet, und von dessen Erfüllung Gott vor seinem Eintritt in das Land seinen Beistand und seinen Segen im Lande abhängig gemacht (Kap. 28, 69 und 29, 8)."
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Gevia Kesef 14:12,"So in general the (main) purpose of writing this narrative in the Torah is this one. Perhaps, as Maimonides wrote, (47. Maimonides (Guide III:24) said that Abraham established the unity of God, by drawing people to his faith.)  its impact exists up to the present time. (Moses) wrote this (chapter) and did what he could, even though he saw at the end that the people would “rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land,” (48. Deut. 31:16.)  (for he wanted) peace and truth in his own lifetime. (Moses) communicated this to them in the context of Abraham, our first patriarch, for God had prevented him from making such a sacrifice to Him, and Abraham had made the sacrifice to Him by substituting a ram, (teaching that) it is proper for us to do the same. It was especially on this account that He commanded that a ram be included in the sacrifices to be made to Him. While this was to be communicated to the masses, it was also to be understood, by the select individuals among us, that even the sacrifice of a ram and other animals was something not desirable to the Lord. Reliable evidence of this is that clearly, after God told him “lay not thy hand upon the lad,” it is not written that He said to Abraham, “instead offer a sacrifice to me using a ram or another (animal).” Instead it is stated that Abraham, of his own volition, “took the ram and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.” This was to teach us that (the sacrifice of the ram) was not the Lord’s first and primary intention. It is also careful not to say that Abraham sacrificed the ram on the altar that he had built, but (it says that) he offered it on the mountain, (49. V. 14, “in the mount where the Lord is seen.”)  as if to teach us that it is not proper to do such a thing on an altar, or on any attractive structure. The reason is that an altar without any sacrifice on it is more acceptable as a sign and a memorial, | as I said earlier. (50. See chap VI, p. 161, where Kaspi indicates a preference for altars that serve as memorials rather than as places of sacrifice.)  And though even an altar and house (of offering) are themselves not the most desired good, they are nonetheless more acceptable, if made, than is sacrifice, as Maimonides wrote. (51. Guide III:32.) "

And it will forsake Me, and it will breach My covenant that I made with it."
31,16,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 6","“The alien gods in the land” [31:16]. The verse teaches us that no angel is appointed over the land of Israel, but the Holy One Himself is the Lord over the land of Israel. However, angels and constellations are placed over other lands. However, the Holy One Himself is the Lord in heaven over the land of Israel. Over Ishmael is the constellation called Cancer. Over the king of the Persians is the constellation called Sagittarius. Over the Philistines there is a constellation called Capricorn. Over Edom there is a constellation called Libra. Therefore, the Holy One punishes Israel more than all the other nations when they worship foreign gods, since Israel is the portion of the Holy One, but the nations are the portion of the constellations. Therefore, the nations who lived in the land of Israel were destroyed because they worshiped foreign gods in the holy land, in the land of Israel. However, in other lands when the nations worshiped foreign gods, He did not punish them, since the Holy One has His supervision over the land of Israel, and the land of Israel is blessed more than other lands, as the verse says, “who gives rain to the earth, and sends water over the fields” [Job, 5:10]. This means, the Holy One Himself gives rain over the land of Israel. However, over other lands He sends rain through messengers. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:16.) "
31,16,Jewish Thought,Derashot HaRan 4:21,"The answer: That sin which is cause for apprehension on the Blessed One's part as potentially resulting in the destruction of the Jews is idol worship, to which the sin of the golden calf was similar in character. For the other transgressions do not arouse the Blessed One's wrath to such a great extent; idol worship is to be much more feared in this regard. And there is more reason for apprehension of this sin in the desert than in the land of Israel. For the Jews knew that the other lands were under the ordinance of stars and constellations, as our sages state (Kethuboth 110b): ""All who live in the land of Israel, it is as if they have a G-d; all who live outside the land of Israel, it is as if they do not have a G-d."" This is because the other, gentile lands are under the ordinance of heavenly plenipotentiaries, an ordinance which cannot be changed except through miraculous, Heavenly intervention (this being the intent of ""for he will not forgive your sins""). Therefore, if one lives outside the land of Israel, because he is under the ordinance of a star or of a constellation, his prayer is not so readily accepted as it would be if he lived in the land of Israel, which is not under the dominion of a chief, an officer, or a ruler, but of the Blessed One Himself, as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:16): ""and they go astray after the strange gods of the land"" — indicating that all gods, except the Blessed One Himself, are strangers in that land. And because the Jews knew this, they would be more apt to stray into idol worship outside the land of Israel, the province of other powers (as they, indeed, said [Exodus 32:1]: ""Arise and make us a god which will go before us"") than they would in the land of Israel itself. Add to this the fact that they would more likely cleave to the Holy One in the holy land than outside it and that there is more reason for apprehension that rebellion against the word of G-d would result in destruction in the desert than in the land of Israel in that the desert is a place fraught with the danger of ""snakes, serpents, scorpions, and drought, no water being there"" (Deuteronomy 8:15), so that destruction is more of a possibility there than in other places. This is not as the pseudo-pious would have it, that the power of G-d is constant in all places, for good or for evil. This is not so, but the Blessed One has stamped it into the nature of things that loss is more likely to result in dangerous places than in others, so that if He is not constantly providential of one in such places but abandons him to the vicissitudes of time, then evil will certainly befall him, unlike the case in other places, where there is not cause for such apprehension. Therefore, the Blessed One said to Moses: This does not require My apprising you of My ways, for I have no intention of separating Myself from you, but My presence will go in your midst when I grant rest to you — and them (what is stated of Moses applying to all of Israel, as in ""to heed you on the way,"" where the meaning is obviously not to heed Moses alone). But this did not suffice for Moses, who answered (Exodus 33:15): ""If Your presence does not go, do not take us up from here."" That is, if Your presence does not go, we should not move from this spot at all. For how will it be known that we have been singled out from the other nations if not by Your going with us now? For when we are in the land of Israel, they will attribute our fortune not to us but to the land, seeing that when we were not in the land You did not walk in the midst of our camp. And the Blessed One acknowledged this, saying (Ibid 17): ""This thing, too, that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in My eyes and I have known you by name."" He elaborated here, saying ""for you have found favor in My eyes"" in response to Moses' first having said (Ibid 12): ""and You said: 'I have known you by name and you have also found favor in My eyes'"" — indicating thereby that He was doing so by virtue of Moses' having found favor in His eyes. And He added ""and I will know you by name,"" in response to ""and You said: ""I have known you by name,'"" not as Moses said (Ibid 16) ""so that I and Your people be singled out from all the peoples,"" but ""because you have found favor in My eyes."" And this is also by way of intimating that His acquiescing in walking in their midst and not governing them through an angel would be limited to the days of Moses alone; but afterwards, in the days of Joshua, the aforementioned angel would lead the Jews until they came ""to the rest and to the inheritance,"" as we shall explain."

31,16,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 80:6,"“And his soul cleaved to Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman, and spoke comfortingly to the young woman” (Genesis 34:3).  “And Shekhem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying: Take me this girl for a wife” (Genesis 34:4).  “Jacob heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter, and his sons were with his livestock in the field, and Jacob kept silent until their arrival” (Genesis 34:5).  “Jacob heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter…and Jacob kept silent” – that is what is written: “But a man of understanding will be silent” (Proverbs 11:12).  “And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard, the men were saddened, and they became very angry, as he performed a depravity to Israel to lie with Jacob's daughter, and so should not be done” (Genesis 34:7).  “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard” – Isi ben Yehuda said: Four verses have no resolution, (It is not clear whether the words in the verses under discussion is the last word of the previous phrase, or the first word of the subsequent phrase. See Yoma 52a–b and Rashi on Yoma 52b.)  and they are: “It will be lifted [se’et]” (Genesis 4:7); “Cursed [arur]” (Genesis 49:7); “And will arise [vekam]” (Deuteronomy 31:16); “Shaped like almond flowers [meshukadim]” (Exodus 25:34). Rabbi Tanḥuma adds this one: “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard,” or: “when they heard, the men were saddened.”  “And so should not be done” – even among the nations of the world, as from the moment that the world was stricken in the generation of the Flood, they stood and fenced themselves away from licentiousness."
31,16,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 10:2,"“When a man or a woman will articulate…” – that is what is written: “My son, give me your heart, and your eyes will observe my ways” (Proverbs 23:26). “My son, give,” this is Israel, who are called children, as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). “Me your heart,” just as it says: “Circumsize the foreskin of your heart…” (Deuteronomy 10:16); “you shall place these words of Mine upon your heart…” (Deuteronomy 11:18). “And your eyes will observe my ways,” just as it says: “You shall see it, and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord” (Numbers 15:39). “For a harlot  is a deep pit [and a foreign woman is a narrow well]” (Proverbs 23:27); the verse is speaking regarding idol worship, which is called a harlot [zona], just as it says: “[This people] will stray [vezana] after the foreign gods of the land” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It is called a pit [shuḥa] on the basis of  “a person will be made lowly [vayishaḥ]” (Isaiah 2:9). “Deep,” on the basis of “and a man was made low” (Isaiah 2:9). Likewise it says: “The haughtiness of man will be made low [veshaḥ]…” (Isaiah 2:17). From where is it derived that the verse is speaking of idol worship? It is because it is written thereafter: “And the false gods will entirely perish” (Isaiah 2:18).   “Well [be’er],” because it was by means of idol worship that Israel descended into a pit, as it is stated: “They bound my life in the pit” (Lamentations 3:53). “Narrow [tzara],” just as it says: “He will besiege [vehetzar] you at all your gates” (Deuteronomy 28:52). “Foreign,” this is idol worship, just as it says: “Foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16).  “She, too [af]” (Proverbs 23:28); from where do we derive that idol worship brings wrath [af] upon a person? It is as it is stated: “Lest your heart be seduced, [and you stray and worship other gods]…. The wrath [af] of the Lord will be enflamed against you…” (Deuteronomy 11:16–17). “Will lie in ambush like a kidnapper [keḥetef]” (This is expounded as though it was written baḥataf, meaning hurriedly.)  (Proverbs 23:28), just as it says: “You will be quickly eradicated” (Deuteronomy 11:17). “And increase the treacherous among men” (Proverbs 23:28) – “Men [adam],” this is Israel, who are called adam: “You…are men [adam]” (Ezekiel 34:31). “Treacherous [uvogedim],” just as it says: “A secret for me, a secret for me. [Woe is me; the betrayers [bogedim] betrayed and the betrayer of the betrayers [bogedim] is betrayed]” (Isaiah 24:16).  Another matter, “[and increase [vetosif]] the treacherous among men,” these are the curses in Torat Kohanim, (The book of Leviticus.)  which are calamities after calamities, and it is written in their regard: “I will increase,” just as it says: “And if after these you will not heed…I will increase my blows upon you” (Leviticus 26:18, 21). From where is it derived that the verse is speaking of idol worship? It is because it is written: “I will destroy your high places (The altars used for idol worship were built on high places.)  [and destroy your sun stones]” (Leviticus 26:30).  “To whom woe? To whom alas? [To whom strife? To whom talk? To whom wounds without cause? To whom redness of the eyes?]” (Proverbs 23:29). Although Israel sinned and the Holy One blessed be He delivered them into the hand of the nations of the world due to their iniquities, they [the nations] did not emerge unscathed as, ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He will judge the nations of the world into whose hand He delivered them, just as He did with Egypt and Babylon. This is why “to whom” is written six times – corresponding to the six exiles that Israel was exiled among the nations, and they were all punished on their account. They are: Egypt first, and then Assyria, Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom. Likewise it says: “I am enraged with great rage at the nations that are at ease, for I was mildly enraged, and they augmented the affliction” (Zechariah 1:15). (The nations caused Israel to suffer more than God wanted them to suffer. )  “For I will facilitate the annihilation of all the nations where I banished you” (Jeremiah 46:28). That is why it is stated: “To whom woe? To whom alas…?”  “To those who linger over wine” (Proverbs 23:30), these are Israel, who are called wine, just as it says: “On that day, sing about it, a vineyard of wine” (Isaiah 27:2). “To those who linger,” these are the nations of the world, who linger over wine (Israel.)  to imbibe and take all the fruit of their labor. “To those who come to assess the mixture” (Proverbs 23:30), as they investigate strategies in their regard; how they will be able to take everything that they have, kill them, and cause them harm. “Do not look at wine in its redness” (Proverbs 23:31), the Holy One blessed be He cautions the idolaters that they should not place too onerous a yoke upon Israel. That is what is written: “Do not look at wine in its redness.”    What is “for he who directs his eye to the cup [bakos]”? (Proverbs 23:31). Bakis is written, (The word is written with a yod, kis, but is read with the letter vav, kos.)  as they direct their sight to the purse [bekhisam] of Israel. “Will walk smoothly [bemeisharim]” (Proverbs 23:31); that they [the nations] will take everything that they [Israel] have and leave their houses like a plain [mishor]. Alternatively, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” as each of them [the nations] does to them [Israel] as he sees fit [hayashar be’einav]. Alternatively, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” as they do not deem all the robberies that they rob from Israel as an iniquity, but rather, they think that everything that they do to them is in the category of uprightness [yosher].  “At its end, it bites like a serpent” (Proverbs 23:32). The Holy One blessed be He says to them: Eve, because she followed her eyes upon the advice of the serpent, just as it says: “The woman saw that the tree was good…” (Genesis 3:6). What was her ultimate fate? She was cursed, due to the serpent, seven curses mentioned in the verse, as it is stated: “To the woman He said: I will increase [your suffering and your pregnancy; in pain you shall give birth to children and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you]” (Genesis 3:16). (The verse is expounded to include menstrual blood, the blood of the hymen, the difficulties of child rearing, the discomfort of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, the longing for her husband in his absence, and the fact that while he can directly initiate relations, she must do so discreetly (Eiruvin 100b).)  That tree was wine. You, too, will be punished through Israel, who were called wine, when you look at them and imbibe their assets, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop, [all those who devour it will be guilty, evil will come upon them]” (Jeremiah 2:3).   “And secretes [yafrish] like an adder” (Proverbs 23:32); just as the adder sets a person aside [mafrish]  from their life, to death, so, due to their iniquity, that they perform evil vis-à-vis Israel, He will eradicate them from the world, as it is stated: “Egypt will become desolation [and Edom will become a desolate wilderness, due to the villainy against the children of Judah]” (Joel 4:19) – this is robbery, which is tantamount to murder. That is what is written: “That they shed innocent blood in their land” (Joel 4:19).  “Your eyes will see strange things” (Proverbs 23:33) – instead of the perspective with which the idolaters would look upon Israel, the Holy One blessed be He will bring upon them uncommon calamities that will be incompatible with one another, in the manner that they befell Israel, just as it says: “Many evils and troubles will find it” (Deuteronomy 31:17); evils that are rivals with one another, like a wasp and a scorpion. (The treatment for a wasp sting, cold food, exacerbates a scorpion bite, and the treatment for a scorpion bite, hot food, exacerbates a wasp sting.)   “And your heart will speak contradictions [tahpukhot]” (Proverbs 23:33); you [the nations] turn [mithapekh] against them every day, just as it says: “Indeed, against me he will again turn [yahafokh] his hand all day” (Lamentations 3:3). The heart of Israel loses its sanity due to all the troubles that they perpetrate against them. So the Holy One blessed be He will exact retribution against them measure for measure, as He will bring harsh calamities which will cause them to lose their sanity and He will speak to bring upon them confusion and He will bring terror upon them. Tahpukhot, just as it says: “Terror overwhelms [hafakh] me” (Job 30:15). Likewise it says: “The sound of the Lord as He exacts retribution against His enemies” (Isaiah 66:6) – measure for measure. “You will be like one lying in the heart of the sea” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Pharaoh, who drowned in the heart of the sea, just as it says: “The depths congealed in the heart of the sea.” (Exodus 15:8), and it says: “He hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15). Just as Pharaoh, the Holy One blessed be He smote him with ten plagues corresponding to the ten matters that he decreed upon Israel, and ultimately drowned him, corresponding to: “Every son who is born, [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22), so, the Holy One blessed be He will do to all the idolatrous nations who perform evil to Israel, measure for measure.    “Or like one lying atop a mast” (Proverbs 23:34), this was Sisera. What is written? “He harshly oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years” (Judges 4:3). What was his end? Because he would  harshly curse them and blaspheme them, that is why he died a contemptible death, that He delivered him into the hands of a woman, just as it says: “For the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hand of a woman” (Judges 4:9). That is why it is stated:  “Like one lying” – this was Sisera, in whose regard it is written: “At her feet he knelt, he fell, he lay” (Judges 5:27). “Atop a mast [ḥibel],” as Yael smashed him [hibalto] on his head with the tent peg. That is what is written: “Her hand to the peg she extended, and her right [to the laborer’s hammer]” (Judges 5:26), measure for measure.  Another matter, “or like one lying atop a mast,” this was Haman, who sought to kill all the Jews, them and their children, to plunder all their belongings, and he sought to hang Mordekhai. That is why he received measure for measure; he and his sons died and Mordekhai took all his possessions. That is why it is written: “Or like one lying [ukeshokhev]” – this is Haman, who died an unusual death, just as it says: “There is Edom, its kings and all its princes, who, despite their might, were placed with those slain by the sword; they will lie [yishkavu] with the uncircumcised and with those who descend into the pit” (Ezekiel 32:29). “Atop [berosh],” just as it says: “Let his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews return upon his head [al rosho]” (Esther 9:25). “A mast [ḥibel],” these are his sons, as it is stated: “They hanged him and his sons on the gallows” (Esther 9:25). Ḥibel is nothing other than his sons, just as it says: “Why should God become angry at your voice and destroy [veḥibel] your handiwork?” (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The handiwork of a person, these are his children. Ḥibel; ḥevel is written, this is Haman, who was strangled with a rope [ḥevel]. From where is it derived that his belongings went to Mordekhai? It is as it is stated: “Esther appointed Mordekhai over the house of Haman” (Esther 8:2), measure for measure.  “They struck me, but I did not feel pain” (Proverbs 23:35), woe unto them, to idolaters who do not learn a lesson; what the Holy One blessed be He did to the earlier generations, the later generations did not learn. That is what is written: “They struck me, but I did not feel pain.” The idolaters say: ‘Even though the Holy One blessed be He smote Pharaoh and Egypt on account of Israel; nevertheless, I did not learn my lesson.’ That is what is written: “But I did not feel pain.”    “They beat me, but I did not know” (Proverbs 23:35). [The idolaters say:] ‘Even though He exacted retribution from Sisera, in whose regard it is written: “She struck Sisera” (Judges 5:26), I did not pay attention to it, to learn a lesson from him. “When will I awaken?” (Proverbs 23:35). Moreover, I was waiting for the strike to pass so I can continue to seek Israel’s harm.’ That is what is written: “I will continue to seek it” (Proverbs 23:35). Likewise, it says: “If you crush a fool…in a mortar [with a pestle, his folly will not be removed from him]” (Proverbs 27:22).  Another matter, “My son, give me your heart, [and your eyes will observe my ways]” (Proverbs 23:26). What did the Holy One blessed be He see that led him to ask of Israel that the heart and the eyes shall follow Him? It is because transgression is dependent on them. That is what is written: “You shall not rove after your heart [and after your eyes]” (Numbers 15:39). The eyes and the heart are the two agents of sin. “For a harlot [zonah] is a deep pit, [and a foreign woman is a narrow well]” (Proverbs 23:27), just as Moses said: “After which you stray [zonim]” (Numbers 15:39), saying that harlotry is dependent upon them. The eyes see the harlot, and the heart contemplates her. So, the Divine Spirit said by means of Solomon: “For…a deep pit.” Why did he call her a pit [shuḥa]? It is based on: “For her house sags [shaḥa] toward death” (Proverbs 2:18). “Deep [amuka],” just as it says: “Her guests are in the depths [be’imkei] of the grave” (Proverbs 9:18). “Harlot,” this is a married woman. (Who commits adultery.)  “A narrow well [be’er],” it is because she causes the adulterer to descend to Gehenna. That is what is written: “To the netherworld her steps are supported” (Proverbs 5:5). The netherworld is called a pit [bor], as it is written: “Lord, You elevated my soul from the netherworld; You kept me alive from descending into the pit” (Psalms 30:4). That which it  says: “Narrow,” this is Gehenna, which is wide at the bottom and narrow at its mouth. That is what is written: “He has even moved you from a narrow opening, its bottom broad without straitness"" (Job 36:16). “Foreign,” as she is foreign to you because she is a married woman.   “She, too [af]” (Proverbs 23:28), as she brings wrath [af] upon a person, as it is written: “Do not commit adultery [lo tinaf]” (Exodus 20:13); do not let the wrath [af] benefit [tehene] from you. Alternatively, lo tinaf, do not introduce [titen] wrath [af] between a husband and his wife. “Will lie in ambush keḥetef” (Proverbs 23:28), as the Holy One blessed be He does not wait for a prolonged (Keḥetef with a tav can be interpreted as though it were with a tet, meaning in an instant.) time for the adulterers, in order to exact retribution against them. Likewise it says: “I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers” (Malachi 3:5). “And increase the treacherous among men” (Proverbs 23:28), as she seduces upright people and renders them treacherous and increases the wicked in Israel. That is what is written: “The woman of folly is clamorous…. She sits at the entrance of her house…to call to the passersby who straighten their paths. Whoever is a fool, let him turn here; to one who lacks heart, she says to him: Stolen waters are sweet…but he does not know that the ghosts are there” (Proverbs 9:13–18). That is, “and increase the treacherous among men.”  “To whom woe? To whom alas? [To whom strife? To whom talk? To whom wounds without cause? To whom redness of the eyes?]” (Proverbs 23:29). Regarding the adulterer he says: “To whom woe,” just as it says: “To cause a belly to distend” (Numbers 5:22). (See Bemidbar Rabba 9:35, which describes the punishment of the adulterer.)  “To whom alas [avoi],” this is the father of woe [av oi], just as it says: “And a thigh to fall” (Numbers 5:22). It is because it is the thigh that performs the transgression, that it is called avoi, the father of woe. “To whom strife?” All of these befall whom? The woe and the alas befall the adulterer, who introduces strife between a husband and his wife. That is, “to whom strife?” because the strife is his. Likewise he says: “Who introduces strife between brothers” (Proverbs 6:19); this is a husband and wife who are brethren to each other.  “To whom talk?” – moreover, upon whom do these curses, the woe and the alas, come? That is “to whom talk? To whom wounds without cause?” – this is the harlot, who suffered the wounds of love without cause, (Namely, is suffering needlessly because of the adultery which she committed.)  and with no wound from her husband amuses herself with another. “To whom redness of the eyes,” this is the harlot who gives the adulterer wine to drink, just as it says: “Red eyed from wine” (Genesis 49:12).  Another matter, “to whom talk?"" – this is the oath of the curse, (On the adulterous woman.)  just as it is written: “The priest shall say to the woman: May the Lord render you [as a curse and an oath]” (Numbers 5:21). “To whom wounds without cause?” – due to her affairs, she was wounded unnecessarily, as the priest exposes her hair, seizes her garments; if they are torn, they are torn, if they unravel, they unravel. “To whom redness of the eyes?” – this is the drinking of the water, as immediately when she would drink, her eyes bulged. All of these befall whom? It is “to those who linger over wine” (Proverbs 23:30). From here [we learn] that wine is a cause. “To those who come to assess the mixture” (Proverbs 23:30), when he hears where there is good wine, he pursues it.  “Do not look at wine in its redness [ki yitadam]” (Proverbs 23:31); the Divine Spirit cautioned regarding wine, that a person should not get drunk. Why? Ki yitadam, it is because his destiny is blood [aḥarito dam], as he violates a transgression for which he incurs liability to be put to death. Another matter, Ki yitadam, it is because he desires the blood of [yitaveh ledam] a menstruant and the blood of a zava. “For one who directs his eye to the cup [bakos]” (Proverbs 23:31), bakis is written; due to the kos, he will direct his eye to the pocket [kis] – the Torah employed a euphemism, saying that he would consort with a forbidden relation. “Will walk smoothly [bemeisharim]” (Proverbs 23:31), ultimately, his wife says to him, I have seen like a red rose, (I have seen menstrual blood.)  and he does not withdraw. (All the halakhic obstacles become like a flat plain for him, and therefore he has relations with his wife even though she is a nidda.)  Rabbi Asi said: If he is a Torah scholar, ultimately, he will rule the pure impure, and rule the impure pure. Another matter, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” ultimately he will permit all the transgressions and render them forsaken like a plain [mishor]. He speaks with a woman in the marketplace; he speaks profanity, foul language, in his drunkenness, and is not ashamed. “At its end, it bites like a serpent” (Proverbs 23:32); just as the serpent, because it incited Eve to drink wine, the earth was cursed because of it, as it is stated: “Cursed is the earth because of you” (Genesis 3:17). Likewise, Noah, his son, one-third of the world, (Noah had three children, so if one was cursed, a third of the world was cursed.)  was cursed due to wine, as it is stated: “Noah awoke from his wine…cursed be Canaan” (Genesis 9:24–25). This is Ḥam, who was his third son, and he is called “the father of Canaan” (Genesis 9:18). That is the way he cursed him.  “And secretes [yafrish] like an adder” (Proverbs 23:32); just as this adder sets  the person aside from life, to death, so, wine, sets man aside from the paths of life to the paths of death, as wine causes one to engage in idol worship. That is what is written: “Your eyes will see strange things [zarot]” (Proverbs 23:33), just as it says: “There shall be no strange [zar] god among you” (Psalms 81:10). Alternatively, it causes him to consort with a married woman, just as it says: “Why would you err, my son, with a strange woman [zara]” (Proverbs 5:20). Alternately, he will render the mitzvot foreign to him, just as it says: “You rebuke the accursed, insolent ones [zedim] who stray [from Your commandments]” (Psalms 119:21). Zedim are nothing other than those who err due to wine, just as it says: “An insolent [zed] arrogant man, cynic is his name; he acts with malicious ire” (Proverbs 21:24), this is a drunkard who is called arrogant and a cynic. Arrogant, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Indeed wine is treacherous, so an arrogant man will not find repose” (Habakkuk 2:5). A cynic, from where is it derived: “Wine is a cynic, strong drink is tumultuous, and any who err in it will not become wise” (Proverbs 20:1). “And your heart will speak contradictions [tahpukhot]” (Proverbs 23:33) – as he turns [hofekh] his face from the Holy One blessed be He and from the mitzvot, just as it says: “For they are a fickle [tahpukhot] generation” (Deuteronomy 32:20). “You will be like one lying in the heart of the sea” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Noah, who lay in the ark for twelve months in the midst of the Flood waters, and because he drank and became inebriated, he became disqualified (See Deuteronomy 23:2.)  as he was castrated.   “Or like one lying atop a mast” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Adam, the first man, who was the first of all people. Due to wine, (In accordance wth the view that the fruit eaten by  Adam was fruit from a vine. See Berachot 40a.)  he was punished with death and brought the pangs of death into the world. “They struck me, but I did not feel pain” (Proverbs 23:35); woe unto the adulterer, who does not gain knowledge from what he experienced. He saw what befell the sota due to wine, but did not gain knowledge. “They beat me, but I did not know” (Proverbs 23:35); he saw in the Torah what befell the adulterer due to wine, but did not know how to understand. Rather, he said: “When will I awaken? I will continue to seek it” (Proverbs 23:35), as whenever he will have leisure to engage in harlotry, he will pursue it. We have learned that wine causes harlotry. That is why the Holy One blessed be He wrote the portion of the nazirite after the portion of the sota, so that a person will not perform the act of an adulterer and adulteress, who drank wine and were corrupted; rather, one who fears sin will abstain from wine. That is why it is stated: “When a man or a woman will articulate [to take the vow of a nazirite, to abstain for the Lord]” (Numbers 6:2)."
31,16,Quoting Commentary,Derekh Chayyim 5:9:3,"Exile comes to the world, etc. It can be strongly wondered [about] that which the exile comes on account of [these] four things. For what is the relation of these four things to exile from the land? You need to know and understand these things very [well]; so focus your eyes and your heart on these things which I will explain to you. For if you investigate, you will find that there are three descriptions of the Land of Israel: The first is that His name, may He be blessed, is called upon the land, such that He is the God of the Land. And it is an explicit verse - ""and this people will rise up, and go astray after the gods of/that are the stranger of the land."" And the Ramban, may his memory be blessed, explained: The gods that are foreign to this Land; for the glorious God is called the God of the Land, as it is stated (II Kings 17:26), ""because they know not the manner of the God of the Land."" And likewise (II Chronicles 32:19), ""And they spoke of the God [of Jerusalem], as concerning the gods of the peoples of the earth."" And it is written (Hosea 9:3), ""They shall not dwell in the Land of the Lord."" To here is the language of the Ramban. And this is explained well in the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed. To the point that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Ketuvot 110b) - and Rashi brings it in Parshat Lech Lecha (Genesis 17:8) [on], ""to give you the land to be for you as God"" (see Leviticus 25:38) - ""For the one who lives in the Land of Israel, I am a God to him; but for the one who does not live in the Land of Israel, I am not a God to him."" See there. And accordingly, David said, ""for they have driven me out today, so that I cannot have a share in the Lord’s possession, but am told, 'Go and worship other gods'"" (I Samuel 26:19). But who told David, ""Go and worship other gods?"" Rather, since they drove him out of the Land of Israel, it is as if they told him, ""Go and worship other gods"" (Ketuvot 110b). And this thing is understood. For all of the lands are under the dominion of the upper ministering angels. So there is no [land] upon which the name of God is called other than the Land of Israel. And the second description that the Land has, is that it is called, [the] Holy Land. And this thing is understood."
31,16,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 10:4,"That is what is written: “The words of Lemuel the king” (Proverbs 31:1). Why is Solomon called Lemuel? Rabbi Yishmael said: On the very night that Solomon completed the labor of the Temple, he married Bitya daughter of Pharaoh. There was rejoicing there, in the celebration of the Temple and the rejoicing over Pharaoh’s daughter. The rejoicing over Pharaoh’s daughter overshadowed the rejoicing over the Temple. That is what the parable says: Everyone flatters the king. That is why he is called Lemuel, because he cast the yoke of God’s kingdom from upon him, as though saying: ‘Why does he need God [lama lo el]?’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He considered destroying Jerusalem. That is what is written: “For [this city has been] a cause of My wrath and of My anger [from the day that they built it until this day; remove it from My presence]” (Jeremiah 32:31).   The Rabbis said: Pharaoh’s daughter introduced to him one thousand types of song, and he commanded them to be sung before him that night. She would say to him: ‘This is the way they sing before such-and-such idol, and that is the way they sing before such-and-such idol.’ What did Pharaoh’s daughter do? She spread a hanging over him and affixed on it all sorts of gems and jewels that shone like stars and constellations, and any time Solomon would seek to rise, he would see the stars and constellations and he slept until the fourth hour of the day. Rabbi Levi said: On that day, the daily offering was sacrificed at the fourth hour. Regarding that hour, we learned: There was an incident and the daily morning offering was sacrificed at the fourth hour. Israel were saddened, as it was the day of the dedication of the Temple, but they were unable to do anything because Solomon was sleeping and they were afraid to wake him due to fear of the monarchy. They went and informed Bathsheba his mother and she went and woke him and rebuked him. That is what is written: “The oration with which his mother admonished him” (Proverbs 31:1).  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It teaches that his mother bent him over a post and said to him: “What, my son?” (Proverbs 31:2) – everyone knows that your father was God-fearing. Now, this is what they will say: Bathsheba his mother caused him to do thus. “What, son of my womb?” (Proverbs 31:2) – all the women of your father’s household, once they became pregnant, they would never see the face of the king, but I forced my way and entered so that my son would be fair and agile. (The Rabbis say that relations during the last trimester are beneficial to the fetus.)  “And what, son of my vows?” (Proverbs 31:2) – all the women of your father’s household, when they would become pregnant they would vow and say: ‘Let me have a son who is worthy of kingship,’ but I vowed and said: ‘Let me have a son who will be quick and scholarly in Torah and worthy of prophecy.’ “Do not give your strength to women” (Proverbs 31:3) – you would be pursuing lewdness, as they agitate a man’s mind: “A companion of harlots will lose a fortune” (Proverbs 29:3). “Or let your ways destroy kings” (Proverbs 31:3); the Torah cautioned and said: “He shall not amass for himself many wives” (Deuteronomy 17:17). Be careful regarding these matters, as they destroy kings. “It is not for kings, Lemuel” (Proverbs 31:4); what [business] do you have with kings who say: ‘Why do we need God [lama lanu el],’ and [you] emulate their actions? “It is not for kings to drink wine” (Proverbs 31:4) – why do you liken yourself to kings who drink wine, become inebriated, and perform all kinds of acts of lewdness? Do not emulate their actions.  “Or for princes: Where is strong drink?” (Proverbs 31:4). Shall one for whom all the secrets of the world are revealed drink wine and become inebriated? “Lest he drink, and forget what was legislated [meḥukak]” (Proverbs 31:5) – Rabbi Shimon said: These are the words of the Torah that are inscribed [haḥakukim], and it is written among them: “You shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:13). “And subvert justice for all the children of the poor” (Proverbs 31:5), she [his mother] said to him: Justice was entrusted to the kingdom of the House of David, just as it is written: “House of David, so said the Lord: Adjudicate justice in the morning” (Jeremiah 21:12). If you drink wine and subvert justice for all the children of the poor, you will exonerate the guilty and convict the innocent. From here they said: A judge who drank a quarter log of wine shall not judge, likewise, a Sage who drank a quarter log of wine shall not issue a ruling.  “Give strong drink to the hopeless, and wine to embittered souls” (Proverbs 31:6). Rabbi Ḥanan said: Wine was created in this world only to pay a reward to the wicked in this world, as they are hopeless in the World to Come, and to comfort mourners. That is what is written: “And wine to embittered souls.” From here they said: All those executed by the court would be given undiluted wine to drink to addle their minds. That is what is written: “Give strong drink to the hopeless.” “Let him drink and forget his poverty, [and remember his misery no longer]” (Proverbs 31:7). Regarding the hopeless, it says that he will forget death, which is his poverty. (He has no reward after death.)  “And…his misery,” is said regarding the embittered soul; one whose sons and daughters die before him and his soul is embittered. The wine will cause his heart to rejoice and he will no longer remember his sorrow. “And remember his misery no longer,” these are his children, who are his misery, like that which we learned: “And our misery” (Deuteronomy 26:7), these are the children, just as it is stated: “Every son that is born [you shall cast into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22).  “Open your mouth for the mute” (Proverbs 31:8), from here [we learn] that if there are none proffering a claim for an heir or for a purchaser, the court proffers a claim on their behalf. Alternatively, “open your mouth for the mute,” this relates to the orphans who do not know how to proffer a claim; moreover, they do not know their father’s business, that the court proffers a claim on their behalf. That is, “for the judgment for all whose lives are transitory [benei ḥalof]” (Proverbs 31:8), these are the children of [someone] dead who passed [sheḥalaf] and went to his eternal home. Another matter, they (The orphans themselves.)  are their father’s replacement [ḥilufei], just as it says: “For whom there is no replacement [ḥalifot]” (Psalms 55:20) – Rabbi Ḥanina said: This is one who does not leave a son after him. “Open your mouth, rule justly” (Proverbs 31:9), that you will not act in a matter that will teach [false] claims.  “And the case of the poor and indigent” (Proverbs 31:9), just as it says: “You shall not distort the judgment of your indigent in his dispute” (Exodus 23:6). Another matter, these are the charities and the gifts to the poor, which is theirs by law, as you must take from the robber and give to them, to realize what is stated: “Do not rob the impoverished, as he is impoverished…” (Proverbs 22:22).  Another matter, “the words of Lemuel the king, the oration [masa] [with which his mother admonished him]” (Proverbs 31:1); this is the Torah that admonished Solomon, as it is called the mother [em] of those who study it, just as it says: “For if [im] you call for understanding” (Proverbs 2:3) – em is written. (The word im and the word em have the same Hebrew letters.)  Why are the words called masa? (Literally, a burden.)  It is because harsh matters will befall anyone who emulates the actions of Solomon. “What, my son [beri]?” (Proverbs 31:2). It does not say “what, beni,” but rather, “what beri.” These are the commands and the prohibitions in the Torah, which is called bar, just as it says: “Kiss bar, lest he become angry…” (Psalms 2:12), as all its matters are clear [barim]. It is regarding a prohibition in the Torah: “You shall not marry them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, [and his daughter you shall not take for your son]” (Deuteronomy 7:3), that it says this matter. It is because Solomon took from the daughters of the nations and married them, as it is stated: “King Solomon loved many…women… from the nations, regarding whom the Lord had said to the children of Israel: Do not consort with them, and they shall not consort with you, as they will sway [your heart after their gods; Solomon clung to them for love]” (I Kings 11:1–2). Ḥananya ben Rabbi Yehoshua said: It is for that reason that it said: “You shall not marry them.” Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Actually “for love” [means] for harlotry. (Namely, he did not marry them.)  Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta says: He did not require them to convert and to draw them near beneath the wings of Heaven.  “What, son of my womb [bitni]?” The Torah cautioned regarding a married woman. This is why beten is written here, as regarding an adulterer and an adulteress it is written: “Her belly [bitna] will distend…” (Numbers 5:27); “to cause a belly [beten] to distend…” (Numbers 5:22).  “What, son of my vows?” The Torah cautioned him not to drink wine so that he would not come to engage in harlotry. This why “my vows” is written here, corresponding to the portion of the nazirite that is written after the portion of the sota. In it, it is written: “When a man or a woman will articulate to take [a vow of a nazirite].” “Do not give your strength to women” (Proverbs 31:3) – after the Divine Spirit alluded to these three prohibitions, (Not to intermarry, not to commit adultery, and not to drink wine.)  it then detailed them specifically. That is what is written: “Do not give your strength to women,” corresponding to the foreign women whom he took and they diverted his heart from the Holy One blessed be He. “Your strength,” that is the strength of the Torah that said: “He shall not amass for himself many wives” (Deuteronomy 17:17), and he violated it.  “Or let your ways eradicate counsel [melakhin]” (Proverbs 31:3), the verse is speaking regarding harlotry with a married woman. That is what is written: “Or let your ways [udrakhekha] eradicate,” just as it says: “As all flesh has corrupted [its way [darko]]” (Genesis 6:12). “Eradicate” – matters of Torah that counsel you to good, just as it says: “Counsel and resourcefulness are mine” (Proverbs 8:14). Melakhin is nothing other than counsel, just as it says: “Therefore, king, let my counsel [milki] be acceptable to you” (Daniel 4:24). That is, “eradicate [lamḥot] counsel,” just as it says: “The [priest] shall write these curses [in the scroll, and he shall dissolve [umaḥa] them]” (Numbers 5:23).  “It is not for kings, Lemuel…” He was called by three names: Yedidya, Kohelet, and Solomon. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Seven – [those three, and] Agur, ben Yakeh, Lemuel, Itiel. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: His primary essence was three: Yedidya, Kohelet, and Solomon. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman concedes regarding these four; that he was called by them as a nickname  and [therefore] they require expounding. Agur, because he accumulated [agar] matters of Torah. Yakeh, because he expelled [heki] matters of Torah, like this bowl that is filled for a while and emptied after a while. Lemuel, as he whispered [nam] to God [lael]: ‘I can amass many wives and not sin.’ Itiel, as he said: ‘God [el] is with me [iti] and I will prevail.’ And it says: “It is not for kings, Lemuel.” The Torah said three matters regarding which kings were commanded: Not to amass many wives, not to amass many horses, and not to amass much gold and silver. They must not say [lomar] to God [lael] that they will amass and will not sin.  “It is not for kings to drink wine” (Proverbs 31:4). This is stated regarding the vow of the nazirite that is written after the portion of the sota, that kings must guard themselves from wine, and likewise princes, so they will not come to lewdness and render the world guilty. Why did it caution kings and princes alone? After all, everybody must be cautious regarding wine so they will not drink and be corrupted. It is, rather, because kings have the wherewithal to drink and do anything in transgression that they wish, and there is no one to reprimand them. “Lest he drink, and forget what was legislated [mekhukak]” (Proverbs 31:5); due to the wine that he drank, he will forget what the Torah commanded to the legislator [mekhokek] (This is a reference to Moses. See Deuteronomy 33:21.)  – the statutes of the Torah; that is the portion of the sota.  “And subvert justice for all the children of the poor” (Proverbs 31:5). This adulterer who goes to the married woman and she becomes pregnant from him, that mamzer (Any child born from a forbidden union that is punishable by karet.)  has no portion in the belongings of her husband, but he will receive a portion of his belongings with his [other, actual] sons because they think he is his son. Another matter, at times, the husband will not leave a son, and by Torah law, the inheritance then goes to his brothers. But this mamzer will inherit his belongings, as they think he is his son, and [this] will subvert justice for all the children of the poor. That is why after the sota, the Torah cautioned regarding the law of the nazirite, as wine causes the adulterer and the adulteress to sin. That is what is written: “When a man or a woman will articulate [to take the vow of a nazirite, to abstain for the Lord].”  From where is it derived that Solomon later conceded? (That he should not have drunk.)  It is as it is stated: “I am a greater fool than a man [ish]” (Proverbs 30:2) – this is Noah, as it is written: “Noah, the man [ish] [of the soil], began [and he planted a vineyard]” (Genesis 9:20) – by means of wine he was cursed, (Since his descendants were cursed as a result of his drunkenness , it is as though he was cursed (Etz Yosef).)  but I [Solomon] did not learn from him. “And the understanding of man [adam] is not mine” (Proverbs 30:2) – this is Adam the first man, who, by means of the wine that he drank, the entire world was cursed because of him, as Rabbi Avin said: Eve poured wine for Adam and he drank, as it is stated: “The woman saw [vatereh] that the tree was good for eating…” (Genesis 3:6), and it is written: “Do not look at [tereh] wine in its redness” (Proverbs 23:31). “I have not learned wisdom” (Proverbs 30:3) – from the wisdom of the Torah, as everywhere that wine is written, it makes an impression. “Nor do I know sacred knowledge” (Proverbs 30:3). One who seeks to sanctify himself so he will not sin with harlotry, shall abstain from wine. I was corrupted with harlotry, but now “I know sacred knowledge.” That is why the portion of the nazirite is stated after sota."

31,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:17:1,"ועזבתים והסתרתי פני מהם, ""and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, etc."" The meaning is that if G'd were to allow Himself to dwell on the troubles which will befall His people, His mercy would be stirred and He would banish His anger. This is why He informs the people in advance that if they were to turn to idols, He, G'd, would turn His face away from them so as not to be tempted to show them compassion."
31,17,Halakhah,Sefer HaChinukh 171:4,"And the general principle of our words is that every bad event that happens to a man is an action that happens to a man by God, may He be blessed, hiding His face from the man — meaning to say, that God, may He be blessed, removes His guarding from upon him, from the angle of his sin, until he receives the fitting punishment according to his sin. And then He commands His angels to guard him, as at first. And [it is] as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:17), “And I will hide My face from them and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles will find them; and they will say on that day, ‘It is because our God is not among us, they found us, etc.’” And one sage wrote, “We know that God is one and the change [only] comes from the receivers.

31,17,Quoting Commentary,"Ephod Bad on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, Ha Lachma Anya 3:1","Matzah: A Remembrance of History and a Symbol of Hope: This is like the bread of poverty which our ancestors ate: As we begin the Haggadah, we do so by emphasizing the power of God. Matzah serves as a symbol of memory. When we refer to the bread of affliction we are reminded that despite the fact that Pharaoh was so powerful that no slave  ever escaped from Egypt, we were able to do so with the help of God. Matzah teaches us that we could not have escaped from Egypt on our own. Other people would have taken credit for their escape, but the bread of affliction is a reminder that we were powerless on o ur own. When we contemplate the meaning of Matzah which our ancestors ate and through which our ancestors merited God's blessings, we are affirm that the hand of God is all powerful, the creator of light and darkness. Matzah  is not the food of slavery but an affirmation of God's providence, the One who creates the rich and the poor. Therefore, all who are hungry come and eat:  We invite the needy  to come and eat with us. Even though the sages tell us that the poor are often humiliated by their poverty, having contemplated the meaning of the Matzah we can now say to them: ""Don't be ashamed"". What we have is not ours. Everything comes from God. We are eating at the table of the Merciful One. Even though you are now in great distress and need, your lowly state is meant to raise you up so that you can accept God's exalted inheritance. All who are in need: We should invite not only those who are hungry  but those who do not  have the means of celebrating and honoring the festival.  Come and celebrate Passover: We invite him to come take whatever he needs to celebrate the holiday for he and we are the same. One should speak gently to a needy person. Say to him: ""Consider this! Has any creature created something from nothing? Can one create fullness out of emptiness? Surely God can make the dejected feel secure and raise up those who have faltered!"" Now we are here (in a place where God's face is hidden) Next year in the land of Israel (where God's providence will be revealed): This is a reference to Deuteronomy 31:17: ""Then my anger will flare up against them and I will abandon them and hide My face from them…And they shall say on that day, 'Surely it is because God is not in our midst that these evils have befallen us.:'"" Now we are slaves, next year free, each person underneath his vine and fig tree. We can only be free when we recognize the power of God. Matzah alludes to the power of renewal. With almost nothing we make Matzah.  God renews the world ex nihilo, out of nothing, just as the bread of affliction  is made without leaven to begin its preparation. The preparation of Matzah, however, begins with something: flour; human beings cannot really create something out of nothing. From the  Matzah, then, we are made aware that God is all powerful and has the ability to reward or punish. When this idea is firmly in our hearts, then we will be 'in the land of Israel' and 'we will be free.'"
31,17,Jewish Thought,"Guide for the Perplexed, Part 1 23:3","The verb “to come out” is thus employed to designate the manifestation of a certain work of God, as we noticed in our interpretation of the phrase, “Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place.” In a similar manner the term shub, “to return,” has been figuratively employed to denote the discontinuance of a certain act according to the will of God, as in “I will go and return to my place” (Hosea 5:15); that is to say, the Divine presence (Shechinah) which had been in our midst departed from us, the consequence of which has been the absence of Divine protection from amongst us. Thus the Prophet foretelling misfortune says, “And I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured” (Deut. 31:17); for, when man is deprived of Divine protection he is exposed to all dangers, and becomes the butt of all fortuitous circumstances: his fortune and misfortune then depend on chance. Alas! how terrible a threat!—This is the idea contained in the words,” I will go and return to my place” (Hos. 5:15)."

31,17,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Khagigah 1:10","When R.

He said: ""Is there any hope for a slave, for whom his master prepares trouble?"" What is the meaning of evils and troubles? Said Rab: ""Evils that trouble each other; for instance, a man is bitten by a bee and a scorpion. To cure the bee's sting warm is needed, and for a scorpion's bite, cold water is needed; hence the use of either will harm the other wound."" (Deut. 31, 17) And My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be given to be devoured. Said R. Bard'la b. Tebyumi in the name of Rab: ""A man from whom God hides not His face is not included in the above, nor is one who is not of those mentioned in the passage given to be devoured (ib. b) included in the above."" The Rabbis said to Raba: ""It seems to us that you are included neither in the hiding of the face, nor in the devouring."" And he rejoined: ""Do you know how much I must send secretly to King Shabur?"" Nevertheless the Rabbis looked at him with an evil eye, and finally men came from the government and confiscated his property. He then said: ""This is what we are taught that Rabban Simon b. Gamaliel says: 'Wherever the sages looked at with their eyes, either death or poverty followed.'"" (Ib.) And I will hide My face from them. Raba said: ""The Holy One, praised be He! said: 'Although I have hidden my face from them, nevertheless will I talk to them in the dream.'"" R.

"
31,17,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 2:11,"“May the Lord answer you on a day of trouble” (Psalms 20:2) – the Rabbis said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king’s son who took to evil ways. He had three tutors. The first said: ‘Let us make for him chains [that weigh] one hundred litra.’ The second said: ‘He will not be able to withstand chains of one hundred litra. Instead, make for him chains [weighing] twelve litra.’ The third came and said: ‘How will he be able to withstand chains of twelve litra? Make for him chains [weighing] one litra.’ So, Moses said: Let chains of one hundred litra be made for them, as it is stated: “Many evils and troubles will find them” (Deuteronomy 31:17). David said: Let chains of twelve litra be made for them, as it is stated: “May the Lord answer you on a day of trouble” – just as the day is twelve hours. When Jeremiah arose, he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, they do not have the strength to withstand what David said: “May the Lord answer you on a day of trouble.” Instead, make for them chains of one litra,’ as it is stated: “It is a time of trouble for Jacob, but from it he will be saved” (Jeremiah 30:7).  Another matter: “May the Lord answer you on a day of trouble” (Psalms 20:2) – Reish Lakish said: To what is the matter comparable? To a woman who was sitting on the birthing stool and she was in distress as she was about to give birth. They said: ‘May He who answered your mother answer you.’ So, David said to Israel: ‘May He who answered Jacob answer you. What prayer did Jacob offer? “I will craft there an altar to God who answers me on the day of my trouble” (Genesis 35:3). You too, “may the Lord answer you at a time of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob fortify you”’ (Psalms 20:2). Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, when You see Your children in distress and there is no one to ask for mercy for them, answer them immediately.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, as you live, whenever they call Me I will answer them,’ as it is stated: “As is the Lord our God in all of our calling to Him.”"
31,17,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:68,"The first : when afflictions come upon a man he considers this in his heart and says that this has happened because of his sins and his evil ways. And then he will return to God, and He will have mercy upon him, as it is said, ""And many evils and troubles shall come upon them, so that they will say in that day: 'Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?' "" (Deut. 31:17). Now this type of repentance, is received by God but not by human beings. For when a man sins against another man, in time of trouble he has remorse and is submissive to him because he needs his help, this remorse is considered worthless in the eyes of the person offended. As Jephthah said, ""And why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?"" (Judges 11:7). But it is one of the great kindnesses of God that He accepts repentance even though it comes from trouble, and He is placated, as it is said, ""Return O Israel, unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity"" (Hos. 14:2). And it is written, ""For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth"" (Prov. 3:12)."
31,17,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 30:1:1","ועשית מזבח מקטר קטרת, “You are to construct an altar on which to bring incense up in smoke.” Nachmanides writes on this verse that the Altar for incense was one of the interior furnishings and as such it should have been mentioned earlier where the Table, and the Menorah and their respective measurements and the materials they were made of were described. They were mentioned together in Exodus 37,25 where the actual construction of these furnishings is reported. The reason that the Altar for incense is mentioned here only at the end of all the instructions and after G’d having said that He would dwell amongst the Jewish people, is that the Torah wanted to wait with this seeing it (the incense) was the instrument of arresting pestilence amongst the Jewish people. In essence, the Altar of incense represented the attribute of Justice. Moses referred to this aspect when he blessed the tribe of Levi (Deut. 33,10) referring to the time when ישימו קטורה באפיך, “they would place incense to counter Your anger.” We know that the word אף is a description of anger when it is used in connection with G’d, such as in Deut. 31,17 וחרה אפי, “and My anger will be kindled, etc.” When the sons of Aaron offered unauthorized incense they died on the spot (Leviticus 10,3). There are numerous verses alluding to the extreme caution to be used when offering incense.  Seeing that Nachmanides has already touched on this difficult subject, it is in place to comment on something Maimonides has written in his Moreh Nevuchim section 3 chapter 45 in connection with the purpose of the incense. He explains that the many animals which were burned on the Altar left behind a very unpleasant odor and that the fragrance of the incense was designed to offset this bad odor."
31,17,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 10:3:1","הוא אשר דבר ה' לאמור בקרובי אקדש, “this is what the Lord had said, saying: ‘I will be sanctified by those nearest Me.’” Where had G’d ever made such a statement that Moses could now refer to it? The first time was in Exodus 19,22 at the time of the revelation at Mount Sinai, where G’d had warned the Priests not to look too much at supernatural phenomena. The Torah had written: “even the Priests who approach Hashem should sanctify themselves lest Hashem will burst forth against them.” [The expression יתקדשו used in this verse always implies imposing restrictions upon oneself. Ed.] This was a warning that the Priests are at greater risk than ordinary Israelites because they are in a preferred position, being closer to Hashem. The expression יפרוץ בהם, “He might burst forth against them,” describes precisely what happened to Nadav and Avihu who were killed immediately they committed this sin. The words used in Exodus 19,22 are that the Priests are coming close to Hashem, i.e. 'הנגשים אל ה, whereas in Leviticus 16,2 the word used by the Torah is בקרבתם לפני ה, “when they approached the presence of the Lord.” Proof that both expressions are more or less identical is found in Jeremiah 30,21 where the prophet uses both expressions in one breath, saying: והקרבתיו ונגש אלי, “I will bring him near that he may approach Me.”  The second time G’d indicated that He would be sanctified by those closest to Him was in Exodus 29,43 (compare Rashi) where the Torah writes (quoting G’d) ונועדתי שמה לבני ישראל ונקדש בכבודי, “and there I will meet with the Israelites, and it shall be sanctified by My glory.” The word ונקדש in that verse is an allusion to what would happen, i.e. a revelation of G’d’s Shechinah to the sons of Aaron. The word לכבודי is a further reference to what Moses told Aaron his brother that G’d had said ועל פני כל העם אכבד, “and I shall be glorified in the presence of the whole nation,” at the end of our verse. The expression בקרובי, “through those close to Me,” in the plural, hints at a variety of matters which could trigger such a sanctification of the Lord’s name. However, seeing that the Torah does not have vowels, it is possible to read this word as a singular i.e. be-kirbi, seeing the word has been spelled without the letter ו which is common to the spelling of the word karov, קרוב. The word would then be a reference to an angel (attribute) attached, within Hashem. We would then have an even more literal allusion in the words quoted from Exodus 29,43 ונקדש בכבודי, meaning ונקדש בקרבי,”I will be sanctified by means of this attribute (angel) within Me.” Similar constructions are found in Hoseah 11,9 בקרבך קדוש, “the Holy One in your midst.” Another similar expression is found in Deuteronomy 31,17 where the people suffering a lot of disasters blame the fact that אין אלו-הי בקרבי, “that it demonstrates that my G’d is not near me” (not “within” me). In that case also, Israel, instead of addressing itself to the essence of G’d, i.e. Hashem, addressed itself to a lesser attribute of G‘d, i.e. the attribute of Justice.” Failure to address one’s prayers or offerings to Hashem, the tetragram, results in retribution by the very attribute of Justice to which one addresses oneself. (Compare what we wrote on verse 1 under the heading “a kabbalistic approach”)."
31,17,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 27:5:2","The truth of the matter is that the reason why Moses turned to G’d is that he himself had forgotten the law on the subject. If he did not know, the less learned judges most certainly would not know either. Seeing that the problem was not complicated and could have been resolved by simply using one’s intellect, and even the Gentile courts have solved it satisfactorily, Moses is faulted for not having known the law on this point. He, who had once said: “if a matter is to difficult for you, present it to me for a decision” (Deut. 31,17) was now denied knowledge of a relatively simple point in law, one that even women were able to work out for themselves. This is why Moses had to present the case of these daughters of Tzelofchod to G’d for a decision.  The reason that the final letter ן is written especially large in the word משפטן, is a hint to a Torah scholar who is an outstanding scholar and who has studied not only Torah but also other disciplines, not to preside over a case in the presence of a scholar who outranks him in wisdom. Rather, if he is asked to preside over a case, he is to present this case to the authority on the subject. We learn this from Moses who did not sit in judgment of a case when he was not certain of the law but presented the case to the Expert, i.e. to Hashem.  If you accept the premise that Moses did not know the law on this point challenged by the daughters of Tzelofchod, surely we must ask how a person such as Moses who had been described by Hashem as בכל ביתי נאמן הוא, “he is thoroughly at home and trusted in My entire House,” did not know such a simple law as that when there are no sons the daughters have precedence over the brothers of the deceased or his father? This statement surely included the fact that Moses was an expert in all the most difficult laws of the Torah! How could he have failed to know this simple halachah? We must assume that he asked G’d in order to teach the scholars the lesson that if even he did not presume to preside over legislation which had not been spelled out but had to be arrived at by mere logic, then a scholar of lesser stature than himself must certainly not presume to determine a case on the basis of logic when there is a more experienced scholar who can decide it on the basis of precedent."
31,17,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:17:1","והסתרתי פני מהם והיה לאכול, “and I will hide My face from them and they will become prey.” Our sages in Chagigah 5 have said: “anyone who does not experience an eclipse of G’d’s face does not belong to them (the Jewish people), whereas anyone who is not subject to becoming prey is also not one of the Jews.” [This confirms the special relationship between G’d and His people Israel. Ed.] When hearing this statement, the other Rabbis said to Rava (the Rabbi quoting it) “you yourself have experienced neither a hiding of the Lord’s face nor have you become prey !” Rava answered: “do you have any idea how much I pay in bribes to King Shevor, (the local authority) in order not to become a victim of this verse in the Torah?” [he meant that the need to pay these bribes proves that he was subject to the curse, hence a Jew.] Even after this reply, the Rabbis looked at Rava suspiciously. In the interval, the king sent emissaries and incarcerated Rava. This proves that Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel was correct when he said that whenever the sages look at someone suspiciously or worse, the “someone” will either die or become poor."
31,17,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:17:2-3","על כי אין אלוקי בקרבי, “because my G’d is not in my midst;” this verse teaches that the Temple was not destroyed and the people of Yehudah were not exiled until the Shechinah had withdrawn from them. This is also what David said in Psalms 68,19: “You rose to the high regions.” Subsequently, David continues with: “You had made prisoners.” You have to appreciate that the meaning of the word בקרבי is derived from קרב, “battle;” its numerical value is the same as that of שדי, i.e. 314. In other words, when this attribute of G’d withdrew the Jewish people lost the battle.  I believe that wherever we find the word בקרב or similar in the Torah there is an allusion in that word to the “awakening” of the attribute of Justice. The root of all this is to be found in Exodus 23,21 כי שמי בקרבו, “for My name is within it” [the angel representing the attribute of Justice]. Other examples are: Genesis 48,16 וידגו לרוב בקרב הארץ, “may they proliferate abundantly like fish, in the midst of the land.” The beginning of that verse referred to the המלאך הגואל אותי מכל רע, “the angel who has redeemed me from all harmful influences,” a clear reference to the attribute of Justice. Other verses in which the word בקרב is clearly indicative of an association with the attribute of Justice are: Exodus 10,1 למען שתי אותותי אלה בקרבו, as well as Exodus 8,18: כי אני ה' בקרב הארץ, or Deut. 15,11: כי לא יחדל אביון מקרב הארץ, “there will not cease to be someone who is destitute in the midst of the land.” The author extends the list; [I will omit further examples in the interest of brevity. Ed.]"
31,17,Commentary,"Torah Temimah on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:17:2","... And it means to say that the ""evils"" are many and also troubling for one another. And it appears that it is good for [Rav in the Talmud] to expound like this and not to leave it, such that ""troubles"" is a noun, like ""evils."" For if so, it should have been written, ""raot vetsarot rabot."" But that it interrupted in the middle with the word, rabot, implied to him that just like the word, ""many,"" describes the word, ""evils,"" so too does the word, ""troubling."""

31,17,Quoting Commentary,Malbim on Job 3:1:7,"And with this he broadens his argument and comes to the same conclusion as that attributed by Maimonides (Guide for the Perplexed Part 3, Chapter 12) to the scholar Al-Razi, namely, that there is more bad than good in the world.   For if the happiness of man and his pleasure in the times of prosperity be compared with the mishaps that befall him, - such as grief, acute pain, defects, paralysis of the limbs, fears, anxieties and troubles, - it would seem as if the existence of man is a punishment and a great evil for him. This author commenced to verify his opinion by counting all the evils one by one.  As the folk-songs and proverbs of many of the peoples of the world say:  'It is a wonder when anything good happens.'  Yea, his misfortunes are many (Deuteronomy 31:17) and enduring too.  Job makes much of this in his argument (Ch.3:17-20). (We would all be better off had we not been born because there is always more bad than good in the world. But this would not be the case if God Himself governed.) "
31,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:17:2,"ואמר ביום ההוא, ""and the people of Israel will say on that day, etc."" They will be intelligent enough to conclude that all the troubles which suddenly overtook them must be due to G'd having deliberately left their midst. Had G'd not abandoned them it would be impossible that He would tolerate such treatment of His people. Compare what the prophet said in Judges 10,11. We gain the impression from there that G'd Himself had become fed up with the sufferings His people had to endure."
31,17,Musar,Sha'arei Teshuvah 2:2,"The first path is [that] when a man encounters troubles, he will consult his heart and say [that] it is only his ways and his plots that have caused this to him, and that his sins have caused [the pain] to his soul. So he repents to God; and He has mercy upon him, like the matter that is stated (Deuteronomy 31:17), ""and many evils and troubles shall befall them; and they shall say on that day, 'Surely it is because our God is not in our midst that these evils have befallen us.'"" But note that the custom among men is [that] if one sins to someone, and [later] at a time of trouble for him regrets it and submits to him because he needs him; such regret will be inferior in the eyes of his fellow - like the matter that Jephthah said (Judges 11:7), ""How can you come to me now when you are in trouble?"" However it is one of the kindnesses of God, may He be blessed, that He accepts repentance [motivated by] trouble and it is desirable in front of Him. And He will generously love the sinner when he returns to Him on the day of his rebuke and from amidst trouble, as it is stated (Hosea 14:2-5), ""Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have fallen because of your sin. Take words with you, etc. I will heal their affliction, generously will I take them back in love."" And it is stated (Proverbs 3:12), ""For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, as a father the son whom he favors."" But if the man does not repent from his evil on the day of evil, and the rebuked does not repent to the Rebuker, his iniquity grows and his punishment will be doubled. Do you not see that if a king rebukes  someone who has sinned to him and he has not become chastised, [the king] will make his punishment harsher and be very hard on him. And it is written    (Leviticus 26:18), ""And if, for all that, you do not obey Me, I will go on to discipline you."" And it is [also] stated (Job 36:13), ""But the impious in heart become enraged; they do not cry for help when He afflicts them."" And if he does not know and does not contemplate that the events have found him because of sins, but rather says like the Philistines (I Samuel 6:9), ""it was not His hand that struck us; it just happened to us by chance"" - there will be fury in front of Him for this, and his iniquity will grow. And the iniquity of this group will be greater than the sin of the first group. Therefore it is written about the first group (Leviticus 26:18), ""I will go on to discipline you."" And it is written afterwards about the other group [we] mentioned (Leviticus 26:21), ""And if you remain hostile toward Me and refuse to obey Me, etc."" For every group that is later in the section is more problematic than the one [above it]. So it is written afterwards (Leviticus 26:23-24), ""And if these things fail to discipline you for Me, and you remain hostile to Me, I too will remain hostile to you."" And afterwards, it is written (Leviticus 26:27-28), ""But if, despite this, you disobey Me and remain hostile to Me, I will act against you in wrathful hostility."" Its explanation is ""you remain hostile to Me,"" because you will say, ""It was just chance that [it] happened to us."" But when a man does not recognize his deeds and does not know that he has the iniquity in his hands from his sinning, he must examine his actions and search his ways, as the matter is stated (Lamentations 3:40), ""Let us search and examine our ways."" But if he surely ignores his eyes and his ideas become foolish and deluded (from the expression in Scripture [Isaiah 19:13], ""The nobles of Tanis have been foolish, the nobles of Memphis deluded""), and he does not investigate his ways and does not know the acts of his hands and that which his fingers have done and says, ""I have not sinned"" - his sin is very weighty, as it is stated (Jeremiah 2:35), ""lo, I will bring you to judgment for saying, 'I have not sinned.'"" And it is stated (Isaiah 42:25), ""it blazed upon them all about, but they heeded not; it burned among them, but they gave it no thought."" And it is stated (Proverbs 19:3), ""A man’s folly subverts his way, and his heart rages against the Lord."""
31,17,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 31:9:7,"In the future there will be a fulfillment of (Isaiah 30:20), “Your Master will not yekanef (conceal Himself) anymore, and your eyes will see your Master.” Then the aspect of panim will be revealed. For now, the countenance of God is masked by nature, by the influence of the constellations, as in (Deuteronomy 31:17), “I shall hide My panim from them, and they will be food [for their enemies].”"
31,17,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 47:1:4,"This is the explanation of “I will hide My countenance [from them], and they will be food [for their enemies]” (Deuteronomy 31:17). The explanation is: Because of the desire for eating, He hides [His] countenance. But a shining countenance is the rectification known as “and Truth.” This is the aspect of Yaakov, as is written (Micah 7:20), “Give truth to Yaakov.” He is also an aspect of tefilin. For Yaakov is tiPhERet, an encompassing of the colors—corresponding to tefilin, which is called Pe’ER (splendor), as is written (Ezekiel 24:17), “Put on your pe’er.”"
31,17,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 67:2:1,"2. One must also ensure that glory has a face. Gluttony causes a blemish of glory, so that it has no face. This is because a person’s table is the aspect of the crown of kingship (Rashi on Yoma 72b), which corresponds to glory, as in “King of glory” (Psalms 24:10). Glory is thus the aspect of Malkhut (Kingship). When a person blemishes through eating, glory is blemished and has no face, as in “I will conceal My countenance [from them], and they will be devoured” (Deuteronomy 31:17). Gluttony, God forbid, is thus a concealment of the face."
31,17,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 47:6:5,"Now, this is a wonderful allusion. If the Jewish people are so stringent not to eat too much, just “from an olive’s worth to an egg’s worth,” then, they are in an aspect of “May God bestow His countenance” and there is a show of favor. But if it is the reverse, God forbid, then from the positive [deduce the negative]. For when they are steeped in the desire for eating, there is a hiding of the countenance, God forbid. This is the meaning of “I will hide My countenance… and they will be food [for their enemies].” That is to say, if they are steeped in the desire for eating, then “I will hide My countenance,” God forbid."
31,17,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 2:25:1,"AND G-D SAW THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained this as meaning that G-d saw the violence which the Egyptians overtly did to them, and G-d knew what was done to them secretly. And Rashi explained: “And G-d knew. He directed His heart to them and did not hide His eye from them.” This is correct in line with the plain meaning of Scripture. At first He hid His face from them and they were devoured, (See Deuteronomy 31:17.)  but now G-d heard their groaning and He saw them, meaning that He no longer hid His face from them; He knew their pains and all that was done to them, as well as all that they required. Now Scripture gives a lengthy account of the many reasons for their redemption: And G-d heard their groaning, and G-d remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob; (Verse 24.)  And G-d saw the children of Israel, and G-d knew; For I know their pains. (Further, 3:7.)  This is because even though the time [of bondage] decreed upon them was completed, they were not worthy of redemption, as was explained by the prophet Ezekiel; (Ezekiel 20:6-10.)  it was only on account of the cry (And we cried unto the Eternal, the G-d of our fathers, and the Eternal heard our voice (Deuteronomy 26:7). See also Numbers 20:16.)  that He in His mercies accepted their prayer. By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], there is in this verse one of the great mysteries of the Torah, suggesting that their afflictions came up to the light of His countenance, which brought them [their afflictions] near the Knowledge [of G-d], just as is implied in the verse, In midst of the ‘shanim’ (years) make it known; in wrath remember compassion. (Habakkuk 3:2. Shem Tov ibn Gaon, (a Spanish Cabalist of the pupils of Rashba — printed in Ma’or V’shamesh, Livorno, 1839), explains that Ramban’s intent in mentioning this verse is that the word shanim (years) should be understood as sh’nayim (two), a reference to the two Divine attributes, justice and mercy. When they unite, Israel is remembered for help and redemption. This is explicitly referred to in the second half of the verse: in wrath remember compassion.)  It is for this reason that Scripture gives this lengthy account — [And G-d saw the children of Israel, and G-d knew] — after already having mentioned, And G-d heard… and G-d remembered. (Verse 24.)  This verse, [And G-d saw…,] has been explained in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah. (Also called Sefer Habahir. Ramban’s reference is found there in paragraph 76 (Margoliot ed.). See Vol. I, p. 24, Note 42. Ramban was the first author to quote from this classic of Jewish mystic thought in an open and extensive manner. See the learned work of Israel Weinstock, B’maglei Haniglah V’hanistar (Mosad Harav Kook, Jerusalem) on various aspects of this book.)  From there you will understand the verse."
31,17,Chasidut,"Toldot Yaakov Yosef, Beshalach 11","And let us first explain ""is there Ad-nai among us, or isn't? And Amalek came."" (Exodus 17:7-8) And the famous question is what is the connection between the issues. And it seems to me that it is known what the rabbis said (Sotah 31a) ""in all their troubles He is troubled"" (Isaiah 63:9) is written and the reading is with an alef [making in all their troubles He was not troubled."" And a sage and smart person will pay attention and understand that suffering for a human being is a suffering for the Shechinah, as it is written (Sanhedrin 6:5) ""My head hurts, My arm hurts"", and so the person will pray over the distress of the Shechinah, and immediately the distress of the human will pass,  and this is what [I say] if a person understands that in all their sufferings God suffers, then there is no suffering. This is what the verse says ""Isn't it because Ad-nai is not in me that all these evils befell me?"" (Deut. 31:17)- if I had paid attention that this is suffering for the Shechinah then Ad-nai would be in me, and then those evils would not have befallen me. And this is easy to understand. And through this we can understand ""because they tested, is there Ad-nai among us or isn't?"" and then ""Amalek came"", since once my God is not in me, this event happened to me. And this is easy to understand.

31,17,Kabbalah,"Reshit Chokhmah, Gate of Holiness 17:103","Another reason for Keri is the pleasure of sleeping all night, as I said in chapter 5, and this is included in “If his sons forsake My law” (Psalms 89:31). And the reason for this is since he relinquished himself from dealing with Torah the Creator becomes his enemy, as it says “if you are slack in the day of trouble, how small is your strength” (Proverbs 24:10). This is measure for measure, since he did not want to connect with the “God fearing woman” [the Shechinah] via the study of Torah, he in turn connects to the External and foreign woman. He thus will bare demons to prosecute him and he will eat the fruit of his doings, since no evil comes down unless man cleaves to the Other Side, which makes the holiness leave, and then the Chitzonim have control over him since they are always ready and available. They are also called “Eleh” (these), as it says “since I do not have God in my midst these evil things befall me” (Deuteronomy 31:17). Therefore, when he awakes he should hasten to get up, since if he does not wake up and goes back to sleep he might sleep on his back facing up, which is cursed by the Scribes, as it says “Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi curses those who sleep on their back facing up” (Tractate Brachot 13b)."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,17,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:17:2","אין אלדי בקרבי .ואמר ביום ההוא וגו׳ vergl. Kap. 7, 21. לא תערץ מפניהם כי ד׳ אלקיך בקרבך אל גדול ונורא. Es sagt nicht: הלא על אשר עזבתי אלרי ועל אשר את הרע בעיניו עשיתי, sondern: על כי אין אין אלקי בקרבי מצאוני הרעות האלה. Nicht in seiner Wandlung, in Gottes Wandlung sucht es die Ursache seines Unglücks. Gott, den es trotz seiner Verirrungen noch glaubt, ""seinen"" Gott nennen zu dürfen, und der ihm seinen Schutz und Beistand gegen die Völker zugesagt, erfüllt seine Zusage nicht mehr, sonst würden es solche Leiden nicht treffen. Es glaubt Gott, anklagen zu dürfen, und vergisst, sich anzuklagen, vergisst, auf die Ursachen zurückzugehen, weshalb Gott sich ihm nicht mehr als ""seinen"" Gott bewährt, vergisst, daß "
31,17,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:17:3","ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני וגו׳, vergisst, daß Gott nur darum in dieser Zeit ihm seine besondere Fürsorge entzieht, weil es seinen Wandel in so hohem Grade verschlechtert, על כל הרעה אשר עשה, weil es sich dem Heidentume zugewendet, כי פנה אל אלהים אהרים! Es hat Gott verlassen, darum wird es von Gott verlassen. Gott ist nur so lange sein Gott, als es Gottes Volk ist, als es sich mit seinem ganzen Sein und Wollen ausschließlich Gott in Erfüllung seines Willens unterstellt, und dieses besondere Verhältnis Gottes zu ihm bedingt – mehr als bei irgend einem Menschenkreise auf Erden – seine besondere völlige Hingebung an Gott in Gehorsam und Treue (vergl. das zu Schmot 33, 5 Bemerkte. Das dortige Zitat Kap. 31, 34 muss heißen: Kap. 32, 34). Die ganze Klage ist ein Irrtum. Gott ist בקרבו, hebt seine besondere Beziehung zu Israel nie mehr auf. Allein eben weil Er בקרבו ist, geht ihm keine Verirrung zum Schlechten hin, treffen es Leiden für Verirrungen, mit welchen es nur zu dem, nicht aber unter das sittliche Niveau der übrigen Völker hinabsinkt, רק אתכם ידעתי מכל משפחות האדמה על כן אפקד עליכם את כל עונתיכם (Amos 3, 2)."
31,17,Jewish Thought,"Guide for the Perplexed, Part 3 51:19","This principle I find also expressed in the Law. Comp. “And I will hide my face them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them: so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?” (Deut. 31:17). It is clear that we ourselves are the cause of this hiding of the face, and that the screen that separates us from God is of our own creation. This is the meaning of the words: “And I will surely hide my face in that day, for all the evils which they shall have wrought” (ibid. ver. 18). There is undoubtedly no difference in this regard between one single person and a whole community. It is now clearly established that the cause of our being exposed to chance, and abandoned to destruction like cattle, is to be found in our separation from God. Those who have their God dwelling in their hearts, are not touched by any evil whatever. For God says: “Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God” (Isa. 41:10). “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee” (ibid. 42:2). For if we prepare ourselves, and attain the influence of the Divine Intellect, Providence is joined to us, and we are guarded against all evils. Comp. “The Lord is on my side; I will not fear; what can man do unto me?” (Ps. 118:6). “Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace” (Job 22:2 1); i.e., turn unto Him, and you will be safe from all evil."
31,17,Kabbalah,"Talmud Eser HaSefirot, Introduction 179","52. In the case of “a concealment within a concealment,” which means that even the “back side” of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is concealed from them – because they do not believe in reward and punishment, as mentioned above – the transgressions they have performed are regarded as willing sins, and they are called completely wicked. This is because they commit heresy by saying that God has no providence over His creatures at all, and they turn to idol worship, as it is written: “for they turned to other gods,” God forbid."
31,17,Quoting Commentary,Kli Yakar on Leviticus 14:2:3,"And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, ""This shall be the law of the one with tzaraat on the day of his purification"": Since on the day when he rejuvenates a good heart within himself and takes on to repent - on that very day he will be brought against his will to the priest, to learn the path of the Lord from him. And the wording, ""and he shall be brought,"" is not talking about moving from one place to another, but is rather speaking about his heart moving from the evil path that he [was on] to the good path. And that is when he takes upon himself to approach the priest and to 'seek Torah from his mouth.' And about this, it stated, ""This shall be the law."" And afterwards, once he has taken on to have pure thoughts and to be pure of eyes, not to see evilly; then (in the next verse), ""And the priest shall go out beyond the camp; and behold the scab has healed"" - [this refers to] that iniquity that caused him to have tzaraat - ""the tzaraat, from the one with tzaraat,"" from someone else (as he is no longer ill with it). So it cannot state, ""from the one struck."" For behold, it is the iniquity that caused him [to do] his deeds. So it must say, ""from the one with tzaraat"" - to teach that the spiritual cure came to him from the angle that he had tzaraat. For it is the tzaraat that forced him to repentance. But the Holy One, blessed be He, nevertheless accepts his repentance, even though it was done out of necessity. And you will find the lack attached to such a repentance explained later [in] Parashat Vayelekh on the verse, ""and many evils and troubles will happen to them"" (Deuteronomy 31:17), see there."
31,18,Kabbalah,"Maaseh Rokeach on Mishnah, Seder Moed, Megillah 7","Another correct reason that the erasure of Amalek is 166 words in the Torah and that there are 166 verses in the Scroll of Esther can be said as follows: It is known that Esther is the secret of the Divine Presence, the trait of Kingship (Malkhut) in the secret of, ""and Esther wore royal (malkhut) garments"" (Esther 5:1). And this is the secret of (Chullin 139b:12), ""From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)."" And the word, astir, spelled full adds up to [a numerical equivalent] of 671, like the count of the name, Ado-nai, with its filling (each letter being spelled out), as is known (in the same way that 166 corresponded to an alternative count of the parallel name of God). And in my humble opinion, it appears that it is for this reason that there are ten sections in the Scroll, to complete the number of Esther, [to] Esther 10. For the Scroll is called the Scroll of Esther - and with the additional ten, it adds up to 671, to indicate her virtue, as she was with the secret of the higher Kingship, Ado-nai, with its filling"
31,18,Chasidut,"Peri Tzadik, Purim 4:1","The matter of that which they said (Megillah 6b at the end), ""juxtaposing a redemption to a redemption is preferable,"" meaning the redemption of Egypt to the redemption of Purim: That is since the redemption of Egypt was the beginning of all miracles and the beginning of the revelation of the holiness of Israel in the world. And it was a miracle revealed to the whole world, that God, may He be blessed, chose us as a people and made open miracles which were not in the way of nature. And it was as is stated (Exodus 15:14), ""Peoples heard and they trembled."" The miracle of Purim, however, is called the end of all miracles (as it is said in Yoma 29b), since everything was with great concealment; and it was clothed almost as if it were the way of nature. For it was caused by that which Ahasuerus took Esther and she found favor in his eyes; it was through this that she [was able to] act and subdue Haman and raise up the Jews. And this is [the meaning of] that which they said (Chullin 139b), ""From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)."" And it is like it is found in the holy books, based on this, that the essence of the descent of a person is when it is hidden from him that he is in a state of God hiding his face. And this [is the meaning of] its being stated, ""haster astir,"" that He will hide the hiddenness of His face. And that was the essence of the miracle of Purim. As they were then at the lowest level, when the Jewish people felt that they were in a state of the greatest hiddenness - as it is stated (Esther 4:3), ""there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and lamenting."" And, as is known, the matter of mourning and lamenting indicates something that is final in a person's mind; that its hope is already lost. And it is like the matter of mourning and lamentation about a dead person, since there is no way to bring him back. But because they felt the hiddenness of God's face, the mourning flipped into a joyful day. And this is [the meaning of] that which they said (Megillah 11a), ""When did all 'the ends of the earth see the salvation of our God?' In the days of Mordechai and Esther."" And the intention about that which is stated (Psalms 98:3), ""all the ends of the earth have seen,"" is not about the nations of the world. For they did not see the salvation of our God, since it was clothed and close to being the way of nature, as mentioned above. And that which it is stated (Esther 8:17), ""and many of the people of the land became Jews,"" was only out of fear of the Jews and fear of Mordechai, since they saw that the king elevated him out of respect for Queen Esther. Rather the intention of, ""all the ends of the earth have seen,"" is about the Jewish people, who were then at the lowest point in hiddenness, to the ends of the earth. And it is precise! Through this, they saw the salvation of our God, precisely through this hiddenness! And this matter is strongly present every year on the days of Purim. It should be made known to all the singular Jewish souls that know in the inner recesses of their heart how they are on the lowest level and feel bitter on account of this. With this itself, it becomes known and shines in his heart, that it is flipping for him from despair to joy."
31,17,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:17,"My wrath will be enflamed against it on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and it, this people, will be for consumption. All the foreign peoples will rule over the nation, oppressing it and destroying it. Many evils and troubles will find it, and it, the nation of Israel, will say on that day: Is it not because my God is not in my midst that these evils found me? These evils are not random occurrences, but are a punishment for abandoning God."
31,17,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:17:1,"והסתרתי פנח מהם, “I will hide My face from them.” This is an expression of G–d’s fondness for the Jewish people, it expresses His grief at what befalls them, just as that of a father who instructs a servant to administer punishment to his wayward son. He cannot bear to do it himself, or to have to watch it being administered."
31,17,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:17:2,"רעות רבות וצרות, “many evils and troubles.” These are evils, which in turn will cause them many troubles. The Talmud in tractate Avodah Zarah folio 28, gives examples of this when describing changes in climate resulting in an abundance of harmful insects which in turn will sting people, etc. People who suffer these stings do not know how to counteract and neutralise the pain resulting from them. This is a metaphor for hostility encountered by Jewish people when in exile. When the gentiles hit them they are afraid even to cry out so that the gentiles will not hate them even more. If they fail to cry out they have to learn to live with the pain."
31,17,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:17:3,"על כי אין אלוקי בקרבי, “on account of my G–d no longer being in my midst.” The Israelites are aware that they have driven G–d’s presence out of their midst, as a result of which they have become the victims of all these phenomena. [but they have not drawn the right conclusions from that, i.e. to repent. Ed."
31,17,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:17:1","והסתרתי פני מהם, “I will hide My face from them.” This is evidence of G-d’s fondness of the Jewish people, His acting like a father who while forced to discipline his son cannot bring himself to watch the pain he is inflicting upon him."
31,17,Talmud,Chagigah 5a:18,"On the same topic the Gemara states: “Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured” (Deuteronomy 31:17). Rav Bardela bar Tavyumei said that Rav said: Anyone who is not subject to His hiding of the face, i.e., whose prayers are invariably answered, is not from the Jewish people, as the verse states about the Jewish people that God will hide His face from them as a result of their sins. Similarly, anyone who is not subject to: “And they shall be devoured,” i.e., gentiles do not steal his money,"
31,17,Talmud,Chagigah 5a:17,"And Shmuel said: This verse is referring to one who provides money to a poor person as a loan during his exigent financial circumstances, but immediately after the borrower is released from the initial pressure by receiving the loan, the lender begins to demand repayment, subjecting the recipient to further pressure. Rava said that this explains the folk saying that people say: A dinar for produce is not found; for hanging it can be found. A poor person cannot find money to buy basic necessities; however, when the lenders hang on and pressure him he must come up with the money somehow."
31,17,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 10:2,"“When a man or a woman will articulate…” – that is what is written: “My son, give me your heart, and your eyes will observe my ways” (Proverbs 23:26). “My son, give,” this is Israel, who are called children, as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). “Me your heart,” just as it says: “Circumsize the foreskin of your heart…” (Deuteronomy 10:16); “you shall place these words of Mine upon your heart…” (Deuteronomy 11:18). “And your eyes will observe my ways,” just as it says: “You shall see it, and remember all the mitzvot of the Lord” (Numbers 15:39). “For a harlot  is a deep pit [and a foreign woman is a narrow well]” (Proverbs 23:27); the verse is speaking regarding idol worship, which is called a harlot [zona], just as it says: “[This people] will stray [vezana] after the foreign gods of the land” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It is called a pit [shuḥa] on the basis of  “a person will be made lowly [vayishaḥ]” (Isaiah 2:9). “Deep,” on the basis of “and a man was made low” (Isaiah 2:9). Likewise it says: “The haughtiness of man will be made low [veshaḥ]…” (Isaiah 2:17). From where is it derived that the verse is speaking of idol worship? It is because it is written thereafter: “And the false gods will entirely perish” (Isaiah 2:18).   “Well [be’er],” because it was by means of idol worship that Israel descended into a pit, as it is stated: “They bound my life in the pit” (Lamentations 3:53). “Narrow [tzara],” just as it says: “He will besiege [vehetzar] you at all your gates” (Deuteronomy 28:52). “Foreign,” this is idol worship, just as it says: “Foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16).  “She, too [af]” (Proverbs 23:28); from where do we derive that idol worship brings wrath [af] upon a person? It is as it is stated: “Lest your heart be seduced, [and you stray and worship other gods]…. The wrath [af] of the Lord will be enflamed against you…” (Deuteronomy 11:16–17). “Will lie in ambush like a kidnapper [keḥetef]” (This is expounded as though it was written baḥataf, meaning hurriedly.)  (Proverbs 23:28), just as it says: “You will be quickly eradicated” (Deuteronomy 11:17). “And increase the treacherous among men” (Proverbs 23:28) – “Men [adam],” this is Israel, who are called adam: “You…are men [adam]” (Ezekiel 34:31). “Treacherous [uvogedim],” just as it says: “A secret for me, a secret for me. [Woe is me; the betrayers [bogedim] betrayed and the betrayer of the betrayers [bogedim] is betrayed]” (Isaiah 24:16).  Another matter, “[and increase [vetosif]] the treacherous among men,” these are the curses in Torat Kohanim, (The book of Leviticus.)  which are calamities after calamities, and it is written in their regard: “I will increase,” just as it says: “And if after these you will not heed…I will increase my blows upon you” (Leviticus 26:18, 21). From where is it derived that the verse is speaking of idol worship? It is because it is written: “I will destroy your high places (The altars used for idol worship were built on high places.)  [and destroy your sun stones]” (Leviticus 26:30).  “To whom woe? To whom alas? [To whom strife? To whom talk? To whom wounds without cause? To whom redness of the eyes?]” (Proverbs 23:29). Although Israel sinned and the Holy One blessed be He delivered them into the hand of the nations of the world due to their iniquities, they [the nations] did not emerge unscathed as, ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He will judge the nations of the world into whose hand He delivered them, just as He did with Egypt and Babylon. This is why “to whom” is written six times – corresponding to the six exiles that Israel was exiled among the nations, and they were all punished on their account. They are: Egypt first, and then Assyria, Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom. Likewise it says: “I am enraged with great rage at the nations that are at ease, for I was mildly enraged, and they augmented the affliction” (Zechariah 1:15). (The nations caused Israel to suffer more than God wanted them to suffer. )  “For I will facilitate the annihilation of all the nations where I banished you” (Jeremiah 46:28). That is why it is stated: “To whom woe? To whom alas…?”  “To those who linger over wine” (Proverbs 23:30), these are Israel, who are called wine, just as it says: “On that day, sing about it, a vineyard of wine” (Isaiah 27:2). “To those who linger,” these are the nations of the world, who linger over wine (Israel.)  to imbibe and take all the fruit of their labor. “To those who come to assess the mixture” (Proverbs 23:30), as they investigate strategies in their regard; how they will be able to take everything that they have, kill them, and cause them harm. “Do not look at wine in its redness” (Proverbs 23:31), the Holy One blessed be He cautions the idolaters that they should not place too onerous a yoke upon Israel. That is what is written: “Do not look at wine in its redness.”    What is “for he who directs his eye to the cup [bakos]”? (Proverbs 23:31). Bakis is written, (The word is written with a yod, kis, but is read with the letter vav, kos.)  as they direct their sight to the purse [bekhisam] of Israel. “Will walk smoothly [bemeisharim]” (Proverbs 23:31); that they [the nations] will take everything that they [Israel] have and leave their houses like a plain [mishor]. Alternatively, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” as each of them [the nations] does to them [Israel] as he sees fit [hayashar be’einav]. Alternatively, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” as they do not deem all the robberies that they rob from Israel as an iniquity, but rather, they think that everything that they do to them is in the category of uprightness [yosher].  “At its end, it bites like a serpent” (Proverbs 23:32). The Holy One blessed be He says to them: Eve, because she followed her eyes upon the advice of the serpent, just as it says: “The woman saw that the tree was good…” (Genesis 3:6). What was her ultimate fate? She was cursed, due to the serpent, seven curses mentioned in the verse, as it is stated: “To the woman He said: I will increase [your suffering and your pregnancy; in pain you shall give birth to children and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you]” (Genesis 3:16). (The verse is expounded to include menstrual blood, the blood of the hymen, the difficulties of child rearing, the discomfort of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, the longing for her husband in his absence, and the fact that while he can directly initiate relations, she must do so discreetly (Eiruvin 100b).)  That tree was wine. You, too, will be punished through Israel, who were called wine, when you look at them and imbibe their assets, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop, [all those who devour it will be guilty, evil will come upon them]” (Jeremiah 2:3).   “And secretes [yafrish] like an adder” (Proverbs 23:32); just as the adder sets a person aside [mafrish]  from their life, to death, so, due to their iniquity, that they perform evil vis-à-vis Israel, He will eradicate them from the world, as it is stated: “Egypt will become desolation [and Edom will become a desolate wilderness, due to the villainy against the children of Judah]” (Joel 4:19) – this is robbery, which is tantamount to murder. That is what is written: “That they shed innocent blood in their land” (Joel 4:19).  “Your eyes will see strange things” (Proverbs 23:33) – instead of the perspective with which the idolaters would look upon Israel, the Holy One blessed be He will bring upon them uncommon calamities that will be incompatible with one another, in the manner that they befell Israel, just as it says: “Many evils and troubles will find it” (Deuteronomy 31:17); evils that are rivals with one another, like a wasp and a scorpion. (The treatment for a wasp sting, cold food, exacerbates a scorpion bite, and the treatment for a scorpion bite, hot food, exacerbates a wasp sting.)   “And your heart will speak contradictions [tahpukhot]” (Proverbs 23:33); you [the nations] turn [mithapekh] against them every day, just as it says: “Indeed, against me he will again turn [yahafokh] his hand all day” (Lamentations 3:3). The heart of Israel loses its sanity due to all the troubles that they perpetrate against them. So the Holy One blessed be He will exact retribution against them measure for measure, as He will bring harsh calamities which will cause them to lose their sanity and He will speak to bring upon them confusion and He will bring terror upon them. Tahpukhot, just as it says: “Terror overwhelms [hafakh] me” (Job 30:15). Likewise it says: “The sound of the Lord as He exacts retribution against His enemies” (Isaiah 66:6) – measure for measure. “You will be like one lying in the heart of the sea” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Pharaoh, who drowned in the heart of the sea, just as it says: “The depths congealed in the heart of the sea.” (Exodus 15:8), and it says: “He hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15). Just as Pharaoh, the Holy One blessed be He smote him with ten plagues corresponding to the ten matters that he decreed upon Israel, and ultimately drowned him, corresponding to: “Every son who is born, [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22), so, the Holy One blessed be He will do to all the idolatrous nations who perform evil to Israel, measure for measure.    “Or like one lying atop a mast” (Proverbs 23:34), this was Sisera. What is written? “He harshly oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years” (Judges 4:3). What was his end? Because he would  harshly curse them and blaspheme them, that is why he died a contemptible death, that He delivered him into the hands of a woman, just as it says: “For the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hand of a woman” (Judges 4:9). That is why it is stated:  “Like one lying” – this was Sisera, in whose regard it is written: “At her feet he knelt, he fell, he lay” (Judges 5:27). “Atop a mast [ḥibel],” as Yael smashed him [hibalto] on his head with the tent peg. That is what is written: “Her hand to the peg she extended, and her right [to the laborer’s hammer]” (Judges 5:26), measure for measure.  Another matter, “or like one lying atop a mast,” this was Haman, who sought to kill all the Jews, them and their children, to plunder all their belongings, and he sought to hang Mordekhai. That is why he received measure for measure; he and his sons died and Mordekhai took all his possessions. That is why it is written: “Or like one lying [ukeshokhev]” – this is Haman, who died an unusual death, just as it says: “There is Edom, its kings and all its princes, who, despite their might, were placed with those slain by the sword; they will lie [yishkavu] with the uncircumcised and with those who descend into the pit” (Ezekiel 32:29). “Atop [berosh],” just as it says: “Let his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews return upon his head [al rosho]” (Esther 9:25). “A mast [ḥibel],” these are his sons, as it is stated: “They hanged him and his sons on the gallows” (Esther 9:25). Ḥibel is nothing other than his sons, just as it says: “Why should God become angry at your voice and destroy [veḥibel] your handiwork?” (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The handiwork of a person, these are his children. Ḥibel; ḥevel is written, this is Haman, who was strangled with a rope [ḥevel]. From where is it derived that his belongings went to Mordekhai? It is as it is stated: “Esther appointed Mordekhai over the house of Haman” (Esther 8:2), measure for measure.  “They struck me, but I did not feel pain” (Proverbs 23:35), woe unto them, to idolaters who do not learn a lesson; what the Holy One blessed be He did to the earlier generations, the later generations did not learn. That is what is written: “They struck me, but I did not feel pain.” The idolaters say: ‘Even though the Holy One blessed be He smote Pharaoh and Egypt on account of Israel; nevertheless, I did not learn my lesson.’ That is what is written: “But I did not feel pain.”    “They beat me, but I did not know” (Proverbs 23:35). [The idolaters say:] ‘Even though He exacted retribution from Sisera, in whose regard it is written: “She struck Sisera” (Judges 5:26), I did not pay attention to it, to learn a lesson from him. “When will I awaken?” (Proverbs 23:35). Moreover, I was waiting for the strike to pass so I can continue to seek Israel’s harm.’ That is what is written: “I will continue to seek it” (Proverbs 23:35). Likewise, it says: “If you crush a fool…in a mortar [with a pestle, his folly will not be removed from him]” (Proverbs 27:22).  Another matter, “My son, give me your heart, [and your eyes will observe my ways]” (Proverbs 23:26). What did the Holy One blessed be He see that led him to ask of Israel that the heart and the eyes shall follow Him? It is because transgression is dependent on them. That is what is written: “You shall not rove after your heart [and after your eyes]” (Numbers 15:39). The eyes and the heart are the two agents of sin. “For a harlot [zonah] is a deep pit, [and a foreign woman is a narrow well]” (Proverbs 23:27), just as Moses said: “After which you stray [zonim]” (Numbers 15:39), saying that harlotry is dependent upon them. The eyes see the harlot, and the heart contemplates her. So, the Divine Spirit said by means of Solomon: “For…a deep pit.” Why did he call her a pit [shuḥa]? It is based on: “For her house sags [shaḥa] toward death” (Proverbs 2:18). “Deep [amuka],” just as it says: “Her guests are in the depths [be’imkei] of the grave” (Proverbs 9:18). “Harlot,” this is a married woman. (Who commits adultery.)  “A narrow well [be’er],” it is because she causes the adulterer to descend to Gehenna. That is what is written: “To the netherworld her steps are supported” (Proverbs 5:5). The netherworld is called a pit [bor], as it is written: “Lord, You elevated my soul from the netherworld; You kept me alive from descending into the pit” (Psalms 30:4). That which it  says: “Narrow,” this is Gehenna, which is wide at the bottom and narrow at its mouth. That is what is written: “He has even moved you from a narrow opening, its bottom broad without straitness"" (Job 36:16). “Foreign,” as she is foreign to you because she is a married woman.   “She, too [af]” (Proverbs 23:28), as she brings wrath [af] upon a person, as it is written: “Do not commit adultery [lo tinaf]” (Exodus 20:13); do not let the wrath [af] benefit [tehene] from you. Alternatively, lo tinaf, do not introduce [titen] wrath [af] between a husband and his wife. “Will lie in ambush keḥetef” (Proverbs 23:28), as the Holy One blessed be He does not wait for a prolonged (Keḥetef with a tav can be interpreted as though it were with a tet, meaning in an instant.) time for the adulterers, in order to exact retribution against them. Likewise it says: “I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers” (Malachi 3:5). “And increase the treacherous among men” (Proverbs 23:28), as she seduces upright people and renders them treacherous and increases the wicked in Israel. That is what is written: “The woman of folly is clamorous…. She sits at the entrance of her house…to call to the passersby who straighten their paths. Whoever is a fool, let him turn here; to one who lacks heart, she says to him: Stolen waters are sweet…but he does not know that the ghosts are there” (Proverbs 9:13–18). That is, “and increase the treacherous among men.”  “To whom woe? To whom alas? [To whom strife? To whom talk? To whom wounds without cause? To whom redness of the eyes?]” (Proverbs 23:29). Regarding the adulterer he says: “To whom woe,” just as it says: “To cause a belly to distend” (Numbers 5:22). (See Bemidbar Rabba 9:35, which describes the punishment of the adulterer.)  “To whom alas [avoi],” this is the father of woe [av oi], just as it says: “And a thigh to fall” (Numbers 5:22). It is because it is the thigh that performs the transgression, that it is called avoi, the father of woe. “To whom strife?” All of these befall whom? The woe and the alas befall the adulterer, who introduces strife between a husband and his wife. That is, “to whom strife?” because the strife is his. Likewise he says: “Who introduces strife between brothers” (Proverbs 6:19); this is a husband and wife who are brethren to each other.  “To whom talk?” – moreover, upon whom do these curses, the woe and the alas, come? That is “to whom talk? To whom wounds without cause?” – this is the harlot, who suffered the wounds of love without cause, (Namely, is suffering needlessly because of the adultery which she committed.)  and with no wound from her husband amuses herself with another. “To whom redness of the eyes,” this is the harlot who gives the adulterer wine to drink, just as it says: “Red eyed from wine” (Genesis 49:12).  Another matter, “to whom talk?"" – this is the oath of the curse, (On the adulterous woman.)  just as it is written: “The priest shall say to the woman: May the Lord render you [as a curse and an oath]” (Numbers 5:21). “To whom wounds without cause?” – due to her affairs, she was wounded unnecessarily, as the priest exposes her hair, seizes her garments; if they are torn, they are torn, if they unravel, they unravel. “To whom redness of the eyes?” – this is the drinking of the water, as immediately when she would drink, her eyes bulged. All of these befall whom? It is “to those who linger over wine” (Proverbs 23:30). From here [we learn] that wine is a cause. “To those who come to assess the mixture” (Proverbs 23:30), when he hears where there is good wine, he pursues it.  “Do not look at wine in its redness [ki yitadam]” (Proverbs 23:31); the Divine Spirit cautioned regarding wine, that a person should not get drunk. Why? Ki yitadam, it is because his destiny is blood [aḥarito dam], as he violates a transgression for which he incurs liability to be put to death. Another matter, Ki yitadam, it is because he desires the blood of [yitaveh ledam] a menstruant and the blood of a zava. “For one who directs his eye to the cup [bakos]” (Proverbs 23:31), bakis is written; due to the kos, he will direct his eye to the pocket [kis] – the Torah employed a euphemism, saying that he would consort with a forbidden relation. “Will walk smoothly [bemeisharim]” (Proverbs 23:31), ultimately, his wife says to him, I have seen like a red rose, (I have seen menstrual blood.)  and he does not withdraw. (All the halakhic obstacles become like a flat plain for him, and therefore he has relations with his wife even though she is a nidda.)  Rabbi Asi said: If he is a Torah scholar, ultimately, he will rule the pure impure, and rule the impure pure. Another matter, “will walk smoothly [bemeisharim],” ultimately he will permit all the transgressions and render them forsaken like a plain [mishor]. He speaks with a woman in the marketplace; he speaks profanity, foul language, in his drunkenness, and is not ashamed. “At its end, it bites like a serpent” (Proverbs 23:32); just as the serpent, because it incited Eve to drink wine, the earth was cursed because of it, as it is stated: “Cursed is the earth because of you” (Genesis 3:17). Likewise, Noah, his son, one-third of the world, (Noah had three children, so if one was cursed, a third of the world was cursed.)  was cursed due to wine, as it is stated: “Noah awoke from his wine…cursed be Canaan” (Genesis 9:24–25). This is Ḥam, who was his third son, and he is called “the father of Canaan” (Genesis 9:18). That is the way he cursed him.  “And secretes [yafrish] like an adder” (Proverbs 23:32); just as this adder sets  the person aside from life, to death, so, wine, sets man aside from the paths of life to the paths of death, as wine causes one to engage in idol worship. That is what is written: “Your eyes will see strange things [zarot]” (Proverbs 23:33), just as it says: “There shall be no strange [zar] god among you” (Psalms 81:10). Alternatively, it causes him to consort with a married woman, just as it says: “Why would you err, my son, with a strange woman [zara]” (Proverbs 5:20). Alternately, he will render the mitzvot foreign to him, just as it says: “You rebuke the accursed, insolent ones [zedim] who stray [from Your commandments]” (Psalms 119:21). Zedim are nothing other than those who err due to wine, just as it says: “An insolent [zed] arrogant man, cynic is his name; he acts with malicious ire” (Proverbs 21:24), this is a drunkard who is called arrogant and a cynic. Arrogant, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Indeed wine is treacherous, so an arrogant man will not find repose” (Habakkuk 2:5). A cynic, from where is it derived: “Wine is a cynic, strong drink is tumultuous, and any who err in it will not become wise” (Proverbs 20:1). “And your heart will speak contradictions [tahpukhot]” (Proverbs 23:33) – as he turns [hofekh] his face from the Holy One blessed be He and from the mitzvot, just as it says: “For they are a fickle [tahpukhot] generation” (Deuteronomy 32:20). “You will be like one lying in the heart of the sea” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Noah, who lay in the ark for twelve months in the midst of the Flood waters, and because he drank and became inebriated, he became disqualified (See Deuteronomy 23:2.)  as he was castrated.   “Or like one lying atop a mast” (Proverbs 23:34), this is Adam, the first man, who was the first of all people. Due to wine, (In accordance wth the view that the fruit eaten by  Adam was fruit from a vine. See Berachot 40a.)  he was punished with death and brought the pangs of death into the world. “They struck me, but I did not feel pain” (Proverbs 23:35); woe unto the adulterer, who does not gain knowledge from what he experienced. He saw what befell the sota due to wine, but did not gain knowledge. “They beat me, but I did not know” (Proverbs 23:35); he saw in the Torah what befell the adulterer due to wine, but did not know how to understand. Rather, he said: “When will I awaken? I will continue to seek it” (Proverbs 23:35), as whenever he will have leisure to engage in harlotry, he will pursue it. We have learned that wine causes harlotry. That is why the Holy One blessed be He wrote the portion of the nazirite after the portion of the sota, so that a person will not perform the act of an adulterer and adulteress, who drank wine and were corrupted; rather, one who fears sin will abstain from wine. That is why it is stated: “When a man or a woman will articulate [to take the vow of a nazirite, to abstain for the Lord]” (Numbers 6:2)."
31,17,Jewish Thought,Derush Chiddushei HaLevanah 6:1:6,"According to my understanding, [there is a correlation between these verses]. Our Sages state (Berachos 40a.)  that “the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge” that Adam ate was wheat, because knowledge is dependent on grain. [The Sages derive this from the fact that] an infant does not acquire knowledge until he partakes of bread. Thus, when “infants ask for bread” and thereby gain knowledge and begin to speak, that is the age at which (Sukkah 42a.)  “a father is obligated to teach his son the verse, ‘The Torah Moshe commanded us…’ (Devarim 33:4.)  and the first verse of the Shema.” Hence, eating grain generates the possibility that, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, You established strength.” This verse uses the word oz for strength. Oz refers to the Torah, as our Sages state,  (Midrash Tehillim 8:4.)  “The [sole] meaning of oz, ‘strength,’ is Torah.”Olelim are young children who have enough intelligence to be able to ask for bread. Similarly, the term yonkim is used to refer to children who study Torah, as stated in the several places in the Talmud, e.g. (Chagigah 15a, b. See also Gittin 56a, 68a, and Chulin 98b for other examples where yanuka refers to an older child.)  “He said to the child (yanuka), ‘Tell me the verse you are studying.’” “Out of the mouths” [of such children] – i.e., because of their Torah observance – “strength is established” for God to disrupt the celestial order [in favor of the Jewish people. Conversely, when the Jews] neglect [Torah observance], God vows, (Devarim 31:17.)  “I will hide My face from them, and they will be consumed,” i.e., the fate [of the Jews] will be given over to the natural order."
31,18,Talmud,Chullin 139b:12,"They also asked Rav Mattana: From where in the Torah can one find an allusion to the events involving Esther? He replied to them that the verse states: “Then My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? And I will hide [haster astir] My face on that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18). They also asked him: From where in the Torah can one find an allusion to the greatness bestowed upon Mordecai? He replied: As it is written with regard to the anointing oil in the Tabernacle: “And you shall also take the chief spices, of flowing myrrh [mor deror]” (Exodus 30:23); and we translate mor deror into Aramaic as: Mira dakhya, which resembles the name Mordecai."
31,17,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 24:1:9,"To come back to the Midrash quoted at the beginning, when man's eyesight is perfect, he makes few errors in perception. Denial of physical health does not originate in heaven. On the contrary, heaven helps in the attainment of perfect health. Therefore, since failing health is usually the result of some moral failure, the deterioration in Isaac's eyesight seems doubly baffling. When someone looks into the king's bedchamber accidentally, observing the most intimate aspects of the king's private life, such a person may become a source of major embarassment to the king. If the person in question happens to be an average citizen, the king might have him executed to save himself future embarassment. If he is the king's son, however, the king may prefer to shutter the son's windows rather than to execute him. At the time of the akeydah, Isaac had become privy to some of G-d’s secrets while he was lying bound on the altar. Afraid that what Isaac had seen might become a source of future embarassment, and to help Isaac avoid making fatal mistakes in the use of his eyes, G-d decided to shutter his ""windows,"" as it were. When Moses complained about his speech defect, using it as an excuse to decline the role of leader of the Jewish people, G-d countered by saying, ""Who gave man a mouth?"" (Exodus 4,11). This means that imperfections in man's physical attributes do not occur through oversight on the part of G-d, but on the contrary; since they are the results of G-d’s actions, they serve a constructive purpose, even though that purpose may not yet have been recognized by the person suffering the handicap. "
31,17,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 37:1:9,"At this point, the author discusses 12 symbolisms in connection with the moon's behavior, linking these to the twelve tribes of the Jewish people. The list is omitted in the interest of brevity. A different way of looking at the aggadah in Chullin 60 is this: Israel (moon) complained against Esau (sun) that it is impossible for both to wear the crown of spiritual success. The difference in their essence makes that impossible. G-d’s suggestion to the moon then was that the moon give up some of its claim to glory in this world, so as to merit the crown of success in the world to come. G-d’s message was that Jews could not expect to be both spiritually and materially successful in the present world as well as in the world to come. When the moon wanted to know why this was impossible, G-d said in effect, ""Go ahead and try."" Although a few Jews succeeded, it became clear that whatever measure of success they did attain, was viewed by the world as essentially belonging to the realm of the material world. They were not credited with being different from other gentiles. So G-d told the moon that in that case it must find its satisfaction in the recognition it would obtain in the eyes of the Almighty. Although it is true that the sun too, plays a part in calendar calculation, since the righteous achieve their status by claiming smallness, it behooves the moon to act likewise. Success in this world, though sometimes forthcoming, cannot be guaranteed; but to try for it with any chance of success, one must be prepared to be humble and unassuming. Proof that the Almighty Himself was not totally happy with the need to advise this path, is provided by the fact that He requested the he-goat offering as an act of atonement for having made this demand on the Jewish people. If we consider all the sufferings undergone by the Jewish people despite the fact that they were persuaded by G-d to reduce their claim to the enticements this world has to offer, imagine what greater suffering would have been in store for us had we not voluntarily agreed to this contraction in size. To sum up then, our Parshah has a threefold purpose: 1) To debunk theories about the moon that are idolatrous. 2) To rebut the argument about the accidental nature of the universe. 3) To strengthen Jewish faith in the ultimate fulfilment of our hopes. "
31,17,Kabbalah,Da'at Tevunot 108:1,"Said the Intellect - In the text it is written (Psalms 30:8) ""G-d with your will you raised me up like a mighty mountain, when you hid Your face, I was afraid."", (Psalms 104:29), ""When you turn your countenance they fear...""; and Moshe our teacher peace upon him already said (Deuteronomy 31:17) ""...and hid my countenance from them and they will be for consumption..."" And this, is because the good - the Holy One blessed is he literally makes it with his G-dly emanation of good, but the negativity is not other than the absence of his G-dly emanation and its nullification, whether minimal or substantial. For the G-dly emanation of the good comes through every rectification which is needed for the good of the object of the G-dly emanation, and if the G-dly emanation were nullified and absent entirely - this would be nullification for the object of the G-dly emanation, complete nullification, but if the G-dly emanation is not completely nullified, but if some conditions of its completeness are nullified and absent - there will be a deficiency in the object of the G-dly emanation, but not complete nullification. By way of example, the G-dly emanation of existence and life if it comes complete with all of the good preparations, then the object of the G-dly emanation will be alive and healthy; and if it were to be nullified completely - the object of this G-dly emanation would die. But if it were not completely nullified, but its preparations were absent and the conditions of its completion, this object of G-dly emanation would not die, but would be side and live a life of affliction, and this is straightforward. And it comes out, that we cannot say that the good and the negative are two G-dly emanations, like you thought, rather they are consequences of the G-dly emanation or its absence in total or in part:"
31,17,Commentary,"Bekhor Shor, Deuteronomy 31:17:1-3","And I will conceal My Face from them this is the way of affection, like a person whose child has sinned agains them and they said to the child's teacher to strike them - they can't bring themselves to look at their child being beaten, because they take pity on them, and they hide their face. Many evils and troubles Evils which are made troubles to one another, like being stung by a hornet and a scorpion (Chagiga 5a) - cooling drugs are good for hornet stings, heating ones for scorpion stings, and the reverse is deadly. And if a hornet and a scorpion bite a person, they will be scared to come in the cold to be healed from the hornet because it's dangerous for the scorpion sting, and to come in the heat because of the horney sting, and they won't know what to do. So too the troubles of Israel in exile - when a nation oppresses them, they are scared to accept it lest they hate them, and if they don't accept it they will become accustomed to do this. Is it not because my God is not in my midst that these evils have found me? since I have sinned and I have caused the Shechina to be separated from me, these troubles have come upon me."
31,18,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Ki Tavo, The Blessing and the Curse 19","On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide My face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, “Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?” And I will certainly hide My face on that day… (Deut. 31:17–18)"
31,17,Chasidut,"Ba'al Shem Tov, Vayeilech 2:1","Then My anger shall bun against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured… (Deuteronomy 31:17) The Baal Shem Tov told a parable: A king once ordered [his servant] to strike and punish his son, the prince, for sinning. However, as long as the king was watching, the servant was too scared to do anything – despite the fact that the king had commanded him. What did the king do? He hid his face so as not to look. Then the servant was able to strike the son, until he repented and cried out to his father. So too, as long as G-d looks over His children Israel, the Forces of Judgment cannot affect them. For we are called children of Hashem. Thus it says: “I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured.” Rav Yibei, Tehilim 17"
31,18,Jewish Thought,"Crisis and Covenant; Jewish Thought after the Holocaust, Chapter 2; The Valley of the Shadow 45","Yet another dimension of Jewish thought spoke about the divine withdrawal from history not as a timeless feature of human freedom but as a specific phase in the history of the covenant. The Torah speaks of the “hiding of the face” of God. But it does so in a particular context, namely the exile of Jews from their land. From the opening chapters of Genesis to the closing speeches of Deuteronomy, human transgression is seen in terms of dislocation, moral and physical. Adam and Eve are exiled from Eden. Moses warns that if the children of Israel sin they too will be exiled. This in turn deepens the alienation between man and God, until man experiences God in His absence, not His presence. “Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them, so that they will say in that day: ‘Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’ And I will surely hide My face in that day…” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18.) "
31,17,Jewish Thought,"Crisis and Covenant; Jewish Thought after the Holocaust, Chapter 3; Israel; Between Exile and Redemption 3","Ever since the first century CE the contours of that history had been clear. The Jewish people was, as the liturgy declared, in exile because of its sins. It would one day repent and be forgiven and would return to its land. This vision was already present in the concluding chapters of the book of Deuteronomy. Disobedience to the terms of the covenant would bring about catastrophe. The people would lose their national sovereignty. They would go into captivity, and there suffer indescribable horrors. Eventually they would reflect on their situation and conclude, “Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?” (Deuteronomy 31:17.)  They would return to God and God would return to them. “Then the Lord your God will bring you back from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where He scattered you. Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.” (Deuteronomy 30:3–4.) "
31,18,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:18:1,"[AND I WILL SURELY HIDE.] The meaning of And I will surely hide is, if they call Me, I will not answer. Scripture compares God to a person who does not see or know what is happening. It is the custom of Scripture to employ two verbs. (Our verse reads, haster astir (I will surely hide). Literally, hide, I will hide.)  Those who know grammar understand this. (That it is biblical style to employ an infinitive followed by a conjugated verb.) "
31,18,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:18:2,"IN THAT THEY ARE TURNED. This, (Idol worship.)  as I previously explained, (See I.E. on verse 16.)  is the great evil. There is no evil which tops it."

31,18,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:18:1,"ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני מהם, not as they thought that I was no longer in their midst; wherever they are My presence is with them, as our sages said in Megillah 29 “wherever the Jewish people have been exiled G’d’s presence accompanies them. However, it does not manifest itself by saving them from their oppressor.”"

"
31,18,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:18:1,"ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני ביום ההוא, ""But I will surely hide My face on that day, etc."" The difficulty in this verse is that G'd is portrayed as hiding His face after the Israelites have already confessed their sins, and have acknowledged that their troubles were due to G'd having turned His back on them. If all our verse wanted to do was to provide us with the reason why what happened so far had occurred, there is no need for this. We already know that G'd turned His face away as a result of the Israelites flirting with local deities! Moreover, why did Moses repeat the mention of G'd hiding His face, i.e. הסתר אסתיר? Another thing which is puzzling is why Moses used such a long-winded expression as על כל הרעה, followed by כי פנה אל אלוהים אחרים."
31,18,Jewish Thought,"Guide for the Perplexed, Part 1 24:2","Whenever the word “to go” is used in reference to God, it must be taken in this figurative sense, i.e., it applies to incorporeal things, and signifies either the manifestation of something incorporeal, or the withdrawal of the Divine protection, an act corresponding in lifeless beings to the removal of a thing, in living beings to the departure of a living being, “walking.” The withdrawal of God’s protection is called in the Bible “the hiding of God’s countenance,” as in Deuteronomy 31:18, “As for me, I will hide my countenance.” On the same ground it has been designated “going away,” or moving away from a thing. comp. “I will depart and return to my place” (Hos. 5:15)."
31,18,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:18:1","ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני, “but I will increasingly hide My presence, etc.” G’d will hide His face once more, as He had done in verse 17. This is remarkable, as we would have thought that now that the people had attributed their misfortunes to G’d withdrawing from them, G’d should respond by showering them with His loving kindness seeing that they had at least acknowledged the impotence of any other deities. The Torah explains why this is not the next scenario by writing:
"
31,18,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:18:2","על כל הרעה אשר עשה, ”on account of all the evil this people have committed.” By having put their faith in idols, G’d had withdrawn His face from them in the first place, as a result of which many misfortunes had befallen them. Now, He must still withdraw His face from them, but not as absolutely as He had done the first, time; this time the withdrawal is only to the extent that the redeemer does not yet come and they will return to their homeland. However, in the meantime, until they confess their guilt completely and show remorse, they will still continue their existence in the Diaspora, without, however, being hounded from one place to another and being exposed to all manner of demeaning insults and degradations. The redemption will not come until the repentance described in 30,2 has become reality.

31,18,Guides,"Introductions to the Babylonian Talmud, Megillah, Introduction to Megillah 3","The Purim story took place during the period of exile between the two Temples and is typical of a time of exile: There was a threat to the very existence of the Jewish people due to the arbitrary decision of a foreign ruler. Even the salvation merely removed the threat, but did not substantially change the living conditions of the Jews at that time. Furthermore, both the threat and the salvation came at a time when the Divine Presence was concealed. This is expressed by the Gemara's statement: From where in the Torah is the name Esther derived? As it is stated: “And I will hide [haster astir] My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18)."
31,18,Midrash,Vayikra Rabbah 11:7,"Rabbi Tanḥuma and Rabbi Ḥiyya say, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i: This midrash came up from the Diaspora in our possession. Wherever it is stated, “it was in the days,” it is nothing other than trouble.   Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: They are five. “It was in the days of Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war, etc.” (Genesis 14:2). This is analogous to the friend of a king who entered a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. Barbarians came and confronted him. When they came and confronted him, everyone said: ‘Woe unto us, for the king will not attend to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is written: “[All the families of the earth] shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to the entire world. The Chaldeans came and confronted him. [People] said: ‘Woe unto us that the Holy One blessed be He will not attend to His world the way that He once did.’ That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Ḥiyya said: They sought to confront only the eyeball [galgal eino] of the world. (Abraham was as precious to the world as the eyeball is to a person. )  They sought to blind the eye [ayin] that confronted the attribute of justice in the world. (The name Ein Mishpat is interpreted as a reference to eye [ayin] and justice [mishpat]. )  “Which [hi] is Kadesh,” Rabbi Aḥa says: Hu (The word “which” is pronounced hi, but written hey-vav-aleph, such that it can be read hu, which literally means  “he.” is written, [indicating that] it was he who sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He, and descended into the fiery furnace. When the kings came to confront him, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai]; “it was [vayhi] in the days of Amrafel the king of [Shinar].”  “It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1). What trouble was there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west; [they devour Israel with an open mouth]” (Isaiah 9:11). This is analogous to a king who entrusted his son to a steward, but the steward hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will become liable to be executed by the king. Rather, I will withhold his wet nurse from him and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats, there is no flock, and if there is no flock, there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, there is no world. So said Aḥaz: If there are no children, there are no students,17If there are no children at the beginning stages of their studies there will be no students at the intermediate level.  and if there are no students, there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there is no Torah, if there is no Torah, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).   Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was his name called Aḥaz? Because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: You may derive it from this [verse]: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim as this time, in whose regard it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). From that moment “I sought Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me [are to become signs and wonders in Israel]” (Isaiah 8:18).18This is stated by the prophet Isaiah. Despite the attempts of Aḥaz, Torah would not be forgotten from Israel.  But were they his children? Were they not merely his students? Rather, it is derived from here that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.”  “It was during the days of Yehoyakim son of Josiah” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, [and the heavens, and their light is not]” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to letters of a king that entered a province. In each and every province that his letters would reach, the residents of the province would stand on their feet, bare their heads, and read them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. But when they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, when Yehudi read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23). When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). When they saw this, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.”  “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a vineyard and three enemies confronted him. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Every son who is born [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22). Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “And the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:16).19This is a reference to the social elites, who were exiled in the exile of Yehoyakhin, eleven years before the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbi, Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda says: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths, and the Rabbis say: Both together were one thousand. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon says: These are Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak says: These are the benefactors. The Rabbis say: These are the counselors. The wicked Haman began uprooting the vines. That is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel. He sought to purchase every foundation.20A literal translation of the Hebrew is: “He sought to purchase every egg,” meaning to control and extinguish all future potential before it could be developed.  When everyone saw that Aḥashverosh was selling and Haman purchasing, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of  Aḥashverosh.”  “It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). This is analogous to a province that owed a tribute to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did residents of the province do? They arose and hung him and appropriated it from him. They [then] said: ‘Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters, that we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us.’ So too, when one of the people of Israel would do something improper, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You demean your judges; as you live, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to withstand.’ What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).  Shimon bar Rav Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: Wherever [the term] vayhi is stated, it refers to trouble or joy; if trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if joy, unparalleled joy. Rabbi Yishmael came and suggested a different distinction: Wherever vayhi is stated there is no joy; wherever vehaya is stated, there is no trouble.   They raised an objection: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light” (Genesis 1:3). He said to them: That too, is not joy, as the world was not privileged to utilize that light, as Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: With the light that the Holy One blessed be He created on the first day a person could observe and see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the actions of the generation of Enosh and the actions of the generation of the Flood were corrupt, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “The light is withheld from the wicked” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11).   They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] evening [and it was morning, one day]” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to come to an end. That is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth [will be tattered like a garment]” (Isaiah 51:6).  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8), [and] third, fourth, fifth, the sixth.21The same phrasing is used in the descriptions of the creation of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth days. See Genesis 1:13, 19, 23, 31. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation require completion; wheat requires grinding, mustard requires sweetening, and lupines require sweetening.  They raised an objection: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph and he was a successful man” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, for as a result, that wicked woman confronted him.  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day [Moses summoned Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel]” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, was not joy, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died. They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses concluded [erecting the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, was not joy, as on the day of the Temple’s construction, it was sequestered.22The Tabernacle was not permanent, and was hidden when the Temple was completed.   They raised an objection: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as Ya’ir, who was equivalent [in stature] to the majority of the Sanhedrin, was killed. That is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, approximately thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather approximately, or like, thirty-six; that is Ya’ir ben Menashe, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin.   They raised an objection: “David was [vayhi] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it is written there: “Saul was hostile to David” (I Samuel 18:9).  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] when the king had settled in his house, and the Lord had given him respite” (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who will build [Me] a house” (I Chronicles 17:4).  They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours.23We have stated our objections; now you state the proofs to your position.  He said to them, it is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep alive a calf of the herd [and two sheep]” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge [from Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 14:8). “He will be [vehaya] like a tree planted near streams of water” (Psalms 1:3). “The remnant of Jacob will be [vehaya] among the nations, [in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the flocks of sheep]” (Micah 5:7).   They raised an objection to him: “It was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: That, too, is not trouble, as on that day, Israel received retribution for its sins, as Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Naḥman said: Israel received great retribution on the day that the Temple was destroyed.24Israel was punished for its sins through the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. Were it not for that, the entire populace would have been killed as a result of their sins (Etz Yosef).  That is what is written: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion, and He will not continue to exile you” (Lamentations 4:22).) "
31,18,Midrash,"Esther Rabbah, Petichta 11","Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Berekhya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great interpreted in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile. Everyplace that vayhi is stated, it means nothing but trouble. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman interpreted in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This midrash came into our possession. Everyplace that vayhi bimei is stated, it means nothing but trouble.  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They are five: “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Amrafel king of Shinar, Ariokh, king of Elasar, Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goyim” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war with Bera, king of Sodom…” (Genesis 14:2). [This is analogous] to the beloved of a king who resided in a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. When barbarians came and afflicted him [the beloved of the king], they [the other residents of the province] said: ‘Woe unto us that the king is not attending to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, “all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:4). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to His entire world. That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). They sought to afflict only the eye of the world [Abraham]. They sought to blind the eye that acts upon the attribute of justice in the world.  ( This probably means that Abraham is responsible for the suppression of the attribute of justice, the result of which is that God rules the world through the attribute of mercy.)  “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Hu [i.e. he rather than she] is written. He [Abraham] sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he went into the fiery furnace. When everyone saw that all the kings came to afflict him, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the reign of Amrafel.” “It was during the days [vayhi bimei] when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land and a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to stay in the field of Moab, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land.” [This is comparable] to a province that owed a tax to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They suspended him [on a pole] and struck him and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters; we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us. So too, when one of the people of Israel would perform inappropriate actions, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: You humiliate your judges; by your lives, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to endure. What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Aḥaz son of Yotam, son of Uziyahu, king of Judah; Retzin, king of Aram and Pekaḥ, son of Remalyahu, king of Israel, went to war against Jerusalem, but he was unable to make war against it” (Isaiah 7:1). What was the trouble there? It was as it is written: “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). [This is comparable] to a king who handed his son over to a tutor, and his tutor hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, the world cannot exist. So Aḥaz thought and said: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars there are no elders, if there are no elders there is no Torah, if there is no Torah there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One, blessed be He, will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls, so that no one would engage in Torah study. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).  Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa derived it from this verse, as it is written: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day because of all the evil that they did…” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But from that moment I hoped for Him, (A reference to the verse quoted above “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17).)  as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did you [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I [Isaiah] and the children whom the Lord gave me are to become signs and wonders in Israel” (Isaiah 8:18). Were they his children? Surely, they were nothing but his students! Rather, from here [we learn] that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [vai]: “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.” “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Yehoyakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder; the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23). [This is comparable] to a king who sent letters from province to province and in each and every province that his letters reached, they would embrace and kiss them, standing on their feet, baring their heads and reading them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. When they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.” “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). [This is comparable] to a king who entered a vineyard and encountered three enemies: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. So too, wicked Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22).  Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “He exiled Yehoyakhin…and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:14). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; the Rabbis said: One thousand artisans and smiths. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables.  Haman the wicked, may he be crushed and wiped out, began uprooting the vines; that is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel, he wanted to devastate the whole house [of Israel]. Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥashverosh.” Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yonatan said: Everywhere that vayhi is stated it refers to trouble or to joy; if it is to trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is to joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabban Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a different distinction: Everywhere that it says vayhi (it was), it refers to trouble, everywhere that it says vehaya (it will be), joy.  They objected: Is it not written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light”? He said to them: Even that is not joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When the Holy One, blessed be He, perceived that the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (after the Tower of Babel) were destined to sin before Him, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “From the wicked was withheld their light” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11).  They objected: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth will be tattered like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6). They objected: It is written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day,” “…a third day,” through the sixth day. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, as they were not completely made, e.g. wheat requires grinding, and mustard and lupines require sweetening. They objected: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as that resulted in that bear (Potifar’s wife.)  confronting him.  They objected: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day, Moses summoned Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, is not good, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died and all of Israel lamented them, as it is stated: “Your brethren, the entire house of Israel, will lament the burning” (Leviticus 10:6). They objected: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was put away when the eternal Temple was built. They objected: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin, was killed; that is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, about thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather “like thirty-six;” ( The verse says: “The men of the Ai killed about thirty-six [ki-shloshim ve-shisha] men…” The prepositional ‘ki-’ can designate approximation, “about thirty-six” or comparison, “like thirty-six.”)  that is Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin [of 70 or 71 members]. What is written there? “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6). They objected: “David was [vayhi] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it resulted in what is written: Saul felt enmity to David” (I Samuel 18:9). They objected: “It was [vayhi] when David dwelled in his house” (I Chronicles 17:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who builds Me the House” (I Chronicles 17:4). They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. He said to them, it is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar and the hills will flow with milk” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep a calf of the herd and two sheep alive, and from the abundance of milk produced, he will eat butter, for everyone who remains in the midst of the land will eat butter and honey” (Isaiah 7:21-22). “The remnant of Jacob will be [vehaya] among the nations, in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passes, tramples and mauls, and there is no deliverer” (Micah 5:7). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and the lost in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt will come and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 27:13). “He will be [vehaya] like a tree planted near streams of water which yields fruit in season; its leaves shall not wither, and whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3).  They objected to him: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Menaḥem (The Messiah.)  was born and Israel made penance for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel made great penance at the moment that the Temple was destroyed. That is what is written: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion” (Lamentations 4:22)."
31,18,Midrash,"Ruth Rabbah, Petichta 7","Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile: (From Babylonia. Presumably, this is a way of stating that it is an ancient tradition.)  Any place that “It was [vayhi]” is stated, [it alludes to] trouble. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: Any place that “It was [vayhi]” is stated, it can serve [to allude to] either trouble or joy. If it is trouble, there is none like it. If it is joy, there is none like it. Rabbi Shmuel said: There are five [instances of] “during the days of [bimei].” “It was [vayhi] during the days of [bimei] Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1) – what was the trouble there? They waged a war. [It is analogous] to the friend of a king who was located in a certain province. Because of him, the king took care of the province. One time, barbarians came and beset him [the king’s friend]. They say: Woe for us, the king will no longer care for the province as he had done. Likewise, the entire world was created only due to the merit of Abraham our patriarch; that is what is written: “They turned back and came to Ein Mishpat, (Ein Mishpat literally means ‘eye of justice’.)  which is [hi] Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Aḥa said: They came to beset the eyeball of the world. (Abraham.)  The eye that overcame the attribute of justice in the world you seek to blind? (The midrash is rhetorically addressing the kings that attacked Abraham.)  “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Hu Kadesh. (The word hi, meaning ‘which is,’ is spelled with a vav as the middle letter, which could be read as the masculine hu. The midrash is reading hi Kadesh as hu kidesh, he sanctified.)  He [Abraham] sanctified [kidesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace. (See Tanḥuma, Lekh Lekha 6.)  When everyone saw that all the kings came to beset him, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; that is, “It was [vayhi] during the reign of Amrafel.” “It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11) – [it is analogous] to the son of a king who had a tutor who sought to kill him. He [the tutor] said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So did Aḥaz say: If there are no kids, there are no rams, and if there are no rams there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd. So Aḥaz thought to say: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, cannot rest His Divine Presence in the world. Therefore, I will seize all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16). Rabbi Ḥanina said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Avin: Isaiah said: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as difficult for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18) – in this world. But from that moment, “I hoped for Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Was it [this verse] fulfilled for him [Isaiah]? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me” (Isaiah 8:18) – were they his [Isaiah’s] children? Were they not his students? It teaches that they were as dear to him as his sons. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [vai]: that is, “It was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.” “It was during the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, and the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23) – [it is analogous] to a king who sent a proclamation to a province. What did the residents of the province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. They said: Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these matters. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), (This is the fifth verse of the first chapter of Lamentations.)  immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the end of the scroll, upon the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; that is, “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.” “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [It was] “to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews” (Esther 3:13). [It is analogous] to a king who entered a vineyard and three enemies beset him: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third sought to uproot all the vines. Likewise, the wicked Pharaoh begin picking the unripe grapes; that is what is written: “[Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:] Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22). The wicked Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “[He exiled Yehoyakhin.…] and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:15–16). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of them were one thousand. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Haman the wicked sought to uproot the entire egg; (Egg, in the sense of the very origins of Israel.)  [as] they say buy [the hen] with the egg (A aphorism meaning that he sought to complete the task, leaving no future.)  – “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥashverosh.” “It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1) – [it is analogous] to a province that owed a tax to the king. What did the king do? He sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They took him, struck him, and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: What he sought to do to us we did to him. Likewise, during the days when the judges judged, an Israelite person would worship idols, and a judge would seek to bring him to trial, and he would come and flog the judge. He would say: What he sought to do to me, I did to him. Woe unto a generation whose judges are judged; (The midrash is reading the verse to mean that it was in the days that the judges were judged, i.e. punished.)  that is, “It was during the days when the judges judged.” Shimon bar Rabbi Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that it [“it was,” vayhi] is stated, [it alludes to] trouble or to joy; if trouble, there is no trouble like it, if joy, there is no joy like it in the world. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a [different] distinction: Everywhere that it says, “it was [vayhi],” [it alludes to] trouble, everywhere that it says “it will be [vehaya],” joy. But it is written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light.” He said to them: Even that is not light of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When He perceived that the wicked were destined to appear, like the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion, (After the Tower of Babel.)  and like the people of Sodom, He took it [the light] away. That is what is written: “From the wicked their light is withheld” (Job 38:15). He sequestered it for the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11). They objected to him: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as the heavens are destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke” (Isaiah 51:6). They objected to him: Is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day.… third.… fourth.… fifth.… sixth” (Genesis 1:8–31). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, e.g., it is necessary to sweeten mustard, lupines must be sweetened, and wheat requires grinding. But it is written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it is written: “For they placed me in the pit” (Genesis 40:15). But it is written: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed [assembling the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was sequestered when the Temple was built, as it is stated: “Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 40:35). (The verse does not seem to be related to the point. Perhaps it is brought to communicate that even on the day that the construction of the Tabernacle was completed, the celebration was tempered by the fact that Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] when Joshua was [at Jericho]” (Joshua 5:13). He said to them: That too is not joy, as Joshua rent his garments, as it is stated: “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6). (After the setback at Ai.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day” (Leviticus 9:1). (The day of the dedication of the Temple.)  He said to them: That too is not joy, as on that day Nadav and Avihu died. (See Leviticus 10:1–2.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] when the king (David.)  dwelled in his house” (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: That too was not joy, as it was then that Natan the prophet came and said to him: “However, you will not build the House” (I Kings 8:19). They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. (Prove that every place it says vehaya it is an expression of joy.)  He said to them: It is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge [from Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be on that day that the Lord will set His hand again the second time, [to recover the remnant of His people]” (Isaiah 11:11). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep [a calf of the herd and two sheep] alive” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, [and they will come…and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem]” (Isaiah 27:13). “It will be that one who is left in Zion and he that remains in Jerusalem [will be called holy]” (Isaiah 4:3). They objected to him: It is written: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Israel made complete penance for their iniquities, on the day that the Temple was destroyed. Conclusion of the prologue to Rut Rabba"
31,18,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:18:1","ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני ביום ההוא, “as for Me, I will most certainly hide My face on that day.” G’d had already mentioned earlier (verse 17) that He would hide His face. On that occasion it referred to the exile in Babylon. Now, when He describes this “hiding” of His face in even stronger terms, it refers to the present exile under the Romans. The repetition of the word “hiding” is a warning that this second exile will be much longer than the first. On the other hand, what the Torah writes also contains a message of consolation in Leviticus 26,44 that G’d will not forsake us even when we are in exile, i.e. “the land of their enemies.”  This verse reveals to us something about the length of this exile we find ourselves in. The combined numerical value of the words הסתר אסתיר is 1336. This appears to correspond to a vision in Daniel 12,12 according to which the redemption would come after 1335 years. [According to this, an opportune time for the final redemption was the year 1405 or 1406, which could have happened during the period the author wrote this, but we ultimately did not merit it then. Ed.]"
31,18,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 2:25:1,"וירא אלוקים…וידע אלוקים. G'd saw,….and G'd knew. After the children of Israel had raised their voices in groanings and prayers and G'd had heard those, He remembered His covenant with the patriarchs. This was the reason He turned His attention to the people. Whenever G'd is described as viewing someone's pain this is sufficient to result in the removal of such pain from the person so afflicted, for His mercy extends to all His creatures. It follows that when G'd is angry He must hide His face from the people otherwise He would have to act in accordance with the principle we have just described. This is why G'd said in Deut. 31,18: ""As far as I am concerned, I will surely have to hide My face, etc."" The word וידע may refer also to information that had thus far been hidden even from the Israelites concerning evil the Egyptians had perpetrated against that people."
31,18,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:18:2,"The fact is that our verse does want to provide a reason for G'd's turning away His face. Someone might say that G'd had not judged the Israelites fairly, G'd forbid, for the prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 27,8: ""assailing them with unchained fury."" Sanhedrin 100 states that ""man will be measured by the yardstick he himself applied in measuring others."" "
31,18,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:18:3,"G'd will certainly apply fair yardsticks when judging the Israelites. At first glance it might appear as if turning His face away from the Israelites results in their being punished over and above what they deserve, as the Judge deliberately ignores what happens to them. Perhaps this is what our verse means when writing ""is it not (only) because my G'd is not in my midst that all these troubles have found me?"""
31,18,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:18:4,"To ward off such an interpretation of the previous verse, the Torah writes: ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פנים, ""and I am surely going to turn away My face;"" I am legally entitled to turn away My face from them. This is why G'd had to repeat the word. ביום ההוא, ""on that day."" On the day they stray after alien gods. The reason the Torah wrote על כל הרעה אשר עשה, is ""on account of all the evil it (Israel) has done."" This is best understood in light of Chulin 5 that ""anyone who admits that idols are independent powers has in fact denied the entire Torah."" G'd explains that as soon as the people turned to idols they had in effect turned away from the whole of the Torah, i.e. from G'd. As a result, even if as a result of G'd's turning His face away from them the Israelites would be afflicted with all the curses of the world this would be no different than measuring them with the yardstick by which they themselves had measured others.."
31,18,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:18:5,"Remember that just as the blessings and rewards G'd has promised are meant for the performance of a string of commandments, etc., so curses and punishments are administered in respect of a string of violations of G'd's commandments. As a result, if someone either transgressed all the commandments bar idolatry, or only committed idolatry, he is deserving of all the punishments as commission of idolatry is considered as equal to committing all other violations. No wonder then that G'd hid His face from His people."
31,18,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Tetzaveh, Torah Ohr 72","When the Talmud asked how we know from the Torah that there would be a Moses, a Haman, a Mordechai and an Esther, these are not idle questions. From the answer the Talmud gives it is evident that there must be a deeper reason for such enquiries. In the case of Moses, the Talmud cites Genesis 6,3 בשגם הוא בשר, that G–d indicated that He made an allowance for the spiritual inadequacies of man inasmuch as part of man is physical. The letters in the word בשגם have a numerical value of 345, the same as the numerical value of the name משה. The Torah alludes to an eventual Haman with the words המן העץ in Genesis 3,11. The letters of Haman are the same as the word Ha-min. When answering the question where Esther is alluded to in the Torah, the Talmud cites ואנכי הסתר אסתיר את פני, ""I will keep My face hidden"" (Deut 31,18). We have an allusion to Mordechai in the Torah, as we mentioned earlier, based on Exodus 30,23 ואתה קח לך בשמים ראש מר דרור, ""And you, take yourself choice spices Mor deror."" The translation of this spice in Aramaic is מירא דכיא."
31,18,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 2:8:1,"8. Rabbah bar bar Chanah recounted: Once, while traveling on a ship, we saw this fish. ChoL (sand) yatva (had settled) on its back and a meadow sprouted up. Thinking it to be dry land we ascended, and we baked and cooked on its back. When its back became hot, it turned over. Were it not that we were near the ship, we would have drowned (Bava Batra 73b). This is the meaning of what Rabbah bar bar Chanah said: we saw this fish — For in our exile the Holy One has, as it were, hidden His countenance.  as in (Psalms 30:8), “You hid Your face.”  is an aspect of compassion,  is an aspect of stern judgment. Thus, all our prayers and petitions are  concerned with His having turned His back to us; that He should return His countenance. As  (Psalms 86:16), “O turn to me ,” and as in (Numbers 6:25, 26), “May God make His countenance shine ”"
31,18,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 36:1:6,"For prior to a revelation of Torah, she is in the aspect of pregnancy, in that the Torah is hidden from him “like the bones within the womb of the pregnant woman” (Ecclesiastes 11:5) —corresponding to “As for Me, I will utterly hide” (Deuteronomy 31:18). In other words, [the soul is] in exile, in the evil traits of the seventy languages. For the shell preceded the fruit, and so anyone who would eat the fruit must first break the shell. Therefore, before the revelation, the soul is obliged to go into exile—i.e., into their traits—in order to break them and so afterwards come to a revelation."
31,18,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 56:3:14,"This is analogous to “I will haster astir (thoroughly hide)” (Deuteronomy 31:18)—that is, “I will conceal the concealment,” so that they will be completely oblivious to the fact that God is hidden. As a result, he will certainly not be able to find Him, since he is completely unaware of the need to look for Him; he is completely oblivious to the fact that God is hidden from him, because the concealment itself is concealed from him, as explained above."
31,18,Chasidut,"Likutei Halakhot, Orach Chaim, Laws of Morning Conduct 1:8:1","GOOD POINTS, OFFERINGS AND MELODIES Reb Noson next cites Chazal’s account of the communal korban tamid, daily-offering, brought in the Beit HaMikdash. Representatives of all three branches of the Jewish people—the Kohanim, Leviim and Yisraelim—participated. Reb Noson will explain how this mirrors beirur of the good points, creating melodies, and elevating the good points as the dibbur of prayer. Now, this refining of the good points from the animalistic desires finds expression in Chazal’s statement: “[There were] Kohanim with their sacrificial service, presenting the offering; Leviim on their platform, chanting and playing music; and the appointed group of Yisraelim, the maamad delegation, standing at their station and reciting passages of Torah.” (Megillah 3a; Taanit 26a ff. Chazal teach that legislation instituted in the days of David HaMelekh divided the Kohanim into mishmarot (lit. “watches”), 24 family groupings tasked with performing the service in the Beit HaMikdash in rotating shifts, a week at a time. Twenty-four mishmarot of Leviim were likewise appointed, tasked with providing musical accompaniment in rotating shifts from a nearby platform while the Kohanim presented the korbanot. The Yisraelim too were divided into 24 groups, known as maamadot (lit. “standing groups”). A delegation of each group of Yisraelim, known as anshei maamad, men of standing, would ascend to Yerushalayim as emissaries of all the people. From their station near the korbanot during the service, the anshei maamad would pray that HaShem receive the offering of their fellow Jews with favor. Meanwhile, the remainder of each maamad of Yisraelim would gather in their towns to pray, fast, and recite from the Torah’s account of Creation, showing that the world exists in the merit of the korbanot. Over time, this collection of special prayers and Torah readings came to be known as Maamadot.) "
31,18,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:18:1,"AND I WILL SURELY HIDE MY FACE IN THAT DAY. The meaning thereof is that [He will hide His face] on a different occasion [for it was already stated in Verse 17, and I will hide My face from them]. Since the Israelites already reflected in their hearts that they sinned against G-d, and that these evils came upon them because their G-d was not among them, it would have been fitting — according to the exceeding mercies of G-d — that He help them and rescue them because they had already denied the idols. This is similar to what is stated, Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest: ‘I have not sinned,’ (Jeremiah 2:35.)  [indicating that the very denial of wrongdoing is a grievous sin, but here the admission of sin should have caused G-d to help them]. Therefore he [Moses] states that, because of the great evil that they did in trusting idols, He will again hide His face from them — not like the first hiding of His face when He hid the face of His mercies and many evils and troubles came upon them (Verse 17.)  — but that only the face of redemption will be hidden and they will abide by the promise of the face of His mercies. [This is the promise of] And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them etc. (Leviticus 26:44.)  [They will not be shown the face of redemption] until they add to the aforementioned regret real confession and perfect repentance, as is stated above, and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d etc. (Above, 30:2.)

This constitutes one's healing. This is not the case with the mystery of hiddenness, as in the verse ""I will surely hide [My face]"" (Deuteronomy 31:18), which is when one is not aware that one is spiritually ill. Then one does not [experience] the healing of one's personal affliction."
31,18,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Isaiah 8:18:2,"[17] And I will wait for the Lord, Who hides His countenance... There is no harsher prophecy than that time when Moses said (Deut. 31:18): “And I will surely hide My countenance on that day.” And even on that very day, He promised them, “And this song shall testify before him as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of his seed” (ibid.)."
31,18,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Daniel 7:25:4,"until a time, two times, and half a time This is an obscure end, as was said to Daniel (12:4): “And you, Daniel, close up the words and seal,” and the early commentators expounded on it, each one according to his view, and the ends have passed. We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): “Fortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty-five],” and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1, 335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31:18): “And I, will hide My face” [the words] הַסְתֵּר אַסְתִּיר add up in gematria to 1,335."
31,18,Chasidut,"Likkutei Etzot, Torah Learning 43","A person who devotes himself to Torah can give guidance even to those who are far from him, despite the fact that he does not know exactly what they need and that they may not even be physically present. His learning and devotion to Torah cause those who are distant to hear the voice of Torah clearly. For the Torah cries out constantly and declares: “How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness?” It is only that her voice is not heard because Godliness has been so heavily concealed as a result of our many sins. Today God is hidden from us in a “concealment within the concealment” — the double hiding referred to in the prophecy of haster astir panai, “I shall surely hide My face” (Deut. 31:18). But devotion to Torah causes that which is concealed to be revealed, and even those who are distant can then hear the voice of Torah raised in warning, and they can all return to God (Ibid.)."
31,18,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 10:2:6,"(Gen. rabba 42(4), Esther rabba Introduction, Lev. rabba 11, Ruth rabba1(7).)  But what did Aḥaz do? He built a throne in the Temple Court. That is what is written: “The throne-hall which they built in the Temple, (This exists no such verse. Probably, as indicated by Qorban ha ˋEdah, the reference is to 2K. 16:18: The Sabbath shelter which they had built in the temple …”) ” etc. Rebbi Onias in the name of Rebbi Eleazar. Why is he called “the grabber (אחז “to grab”.) ”? For he grabbed synagogues and houses of study (To close them down.) . To what may Aḥaz be compared? To a king who had a son whom he entrusted to his pedagogue (Greek παιδαγωγός, the slave accompanying the child.) . The latter wanted to kill him. He said, if I kill him, I will be put to death. But I shall draw his wet-nurse away from him and he will die of himself. So Aḥaz said, if there are no kid goats there are no he-goats. If there are no he-goats there are no goats. If there are no goats there is no shepherd (God.) . If there is no shepherd there is no world; if it were thinkable that there be no world. So Aḥaz was thinking, if there are no children (Going to school.)  there are no adults. If there are no adults, there are no Sages. If there are no Sages, there are no prophets. If there are no prophets, there is no Holy Spirit. If there is no Holy Spirit, there are no synagogues and no houses of study. If it were thinkable, the Holy One, praise to Him, will not let His Presence rest over Israel. Rebbi Jacob bar Abbai in the name of Rebbi Aḥa brings it from the following (That Ahaz had eliminated all religious instruction, Is. 8:17.)  I shall wait for the Eternal, Who hid His Face from the House of Jacob, and put my hope in Him. There was no worse moment in the world than when the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Moses (Deut. 31:18.) : I shall certainly hide My Face at that time. From that moment on, I put my hope in Him, Who said at Sinai, (Deut. 31:21. This was not said at Sinai but in the steppes of Moab; it is a promise that the study of Torah will never cease.)  for it shall not be forgotten by his descendants. What would its use be (Is. 8:18. A different interpretation in the Babli 19b.) ? Behold, I and the children which the Eternal has given me. Were they his children? Were they not his students? But this teaches he loved them as if they were his sons and called them “my sons”."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,18,Chasidut,Mevo HaShearim 5:11,"To sum up the matter acording to our limited understanding: In one hasidic path, the type of revelation privileged in Kabbalah centered in Hokhmah, Binah, and Daat was dominant, and also in hasidism concerning revelation in the vessels [the dominance of the intellect] was evident. In another path, the manner of revelation in hasidism emerging from Hokhmah and Kabbalah was also prevalent, while extending this revelation to the vessels themselves. In yet a third path, these two orientations are combined. In truth, when we examine the works of our sages, we see these distinctions expressed there as well. For when those who champion the holy path in which the mind is strengthened speak of the world, they tend to focus on the question of its [ontic] existence [yeshut], which appears to exist on its own. That is, they often speak of how ‘existence’ does not, in fact, exist. They found totally convincing the Besht’s contention that divine self-limitation (tzimtzum) is illusory, as in the parable of the king who created the optical illusion of walls separating him, yet when one girded himself to approach the king he discovered that in truth there were no concealing walls at all. (See R. Moses Hayyim Ephraim of Sudilkov’s Degel Makhaneh Ephraim to Deut. 31:18.)  They also understood well the words of the Maggid, that the shells (kelipot) are not real, and are merely ‘garbing.’ The notions of the ‘other side’ and of the world and even of a human being are all but apparitions. All existence in this world is but a shell, including that of a person with even his good traits are but the shining shell (kelipat nogah; see Tanya I: 1, 29). Only the soul residing in the mind of the average person, (excepting the truly righteous) is holy, and is revealed only occasionally during prayer. All this is different from the other hasidic path of simple avodah."
31,18,Kabbalah,The Beginning of Wisdom 2:20,"53. The function of Malchut is to reveal HaShem’s-יהו""ה kingdom and presence in the world. When this is fulfilled throughout Creation, Malchut is considered to be a complete stature – Partzuf. However, when man's transgressions cause the concealment of HaShem’s-יהו""ה kingdom from this world, as stated, (Deuteronomy 31:18)  “I shall surely conceal My countenance on that day,” Malchut cannot be considered to be complete, but is, rather, a lesser aspect. This is comparable to the waxing and waning of the moon. (Etz Chaim, Shaar Miut HaYareach; Also see Kinat HaShem Tzvaot, Part One.) "
31,18,Kabbalah,The Beginning of Wisdom 6:18,"136. All the stages of life; embryonic (Ibur), infancy (Yenikah), childhood (Katnut), adulthood (Gadlut) etc., hint at the Divine conducts. (See at greater length in Shaar HaYichud of Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, translated as The Gate of Unity, Ch. 34-35, and the introductions and notes there.)  The embryonic stage (Ibur), in which the embryo is concealed and totally dependent on its mother for sustenance, is comparable to a time of severity, in which the world lacks merit and Divine revelation, as stated, (Deuteronomy 31:18)  “I shall surely hide My face on that day.” It then is sustained solely through HaShem’s-יהו""ה grace and the merit of the patriarchs (Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov). This connection between the embryonic stage and HaShem’s-יהו""ה conduct in relation to His world, is hinted at in the scriptural verse, (Ecclesiastes 11:5)  “Just as you know not what the way of the wind is, or how the bones grow in the womb.” The bondage in Egypt, (GR’A to Sifra D’Tzniuta, end of chapter one.)  as well as our present state of exile, constitutes such a period. The state of the Jewish people during the exodus was comparable to infancy (Yenikah), marking the birth of the nation. However, since they had yet to receive Torah and Mitzvot, they lacked meritorious deeds. In like manner, there is a relationship between all of man’s life stages and the deeds of HaShem-יהו""ה in relation to His world."
31,18,Kabbalah,The Beginning of Wisdom 5:6,"112. Another aspect of the Sefirot is that of “Enclothing” (Heetlabshoot-התלבשות), whereby one conduct is concealed in and acts through a second conduct, which is the external expression of the inner, motivating one. The revealed conduct is considered to be the garment of the conduct concealed within it. Scripture thus states, (Proverbs 27:5)  “Good is a revealed rebuke coming from a hidden love,” (See #23)  for example, a father who punishes or disciplines his child does so out of great love of the child and for his ultimate betterment, by correcting the negative characteristics he sees in him. If he did not care for the child, he would not be moved to discipline him. However, to the casual observer it may seem to be cruel. In such a case, the love and kindness of the father is enclothed, so to speak, within the external expression of punishment and discipline.  112B. Sometimes in HaShem’s-יהו""ה relationship to Israel, the conduct of kindness is enclothed in that of judgment, for their ultimate good, as Scripture states, (Deuteronomy 8:5)  “As a man chastens his son, so does the HaShem-יהו""ה your God chasten you.” So too, concerning the suffering of the righteous, (See #10)  the sages stated, (Talmud Bavli, Yoma 87a)  “It is good for the righteous that [HaShem] does not countenance [their transgressions] in this world.” Scripture describes punishment as the concealment of HaShem’s-יהו""ה countenance, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 31:18)  “I shall surely conceal my countenance on that day.” (The deeper meaning of this verse is, “I shall surely conceal my inner aspect (Panim-פנים) on that day.” This signifies that HaShem’s kindness, which is the inner, motivating force, is concealed by judgement, which is expressed in its stead.) "
31,18,Kabbalah,"Sha'arei Orah, Sixth Gate, Fifth Sefirah 69","After having informed you of this, we now must transmit a very important principle to you. Guard it carefully at all times and in all places, for because they did not understand, many who were wise in their own eyes stumbled in this. This is the matter of what the words, “other gods-elohim acheirim-אלהים אחרים” mean. (Exodus 20:3; Deuteronomy 31:18)  Firstly, know that HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is “lofty and exalted, abides eternally, and His Name is Holy,” (Isaiah 57:15)  He alone is King and reigns over all that exists. His Holy Sanctuary-Heichal HaKodesh-היכל הקודש is central and around it are seven crowns. The seventy ministering angels, as well as their seventy nations are drawn down from these crowns, as already explained. (In the Fifth Gate.)  All seventy ministering angels were divided in the generation of dispersion, each to his language and land. (Genesis 11:1-9)  That is, the seventy ministering angels were divided for the seventy nations of the world, each minister ruling over his specific nation and land. During that time, HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He, selected Avraham, choosing him and his descendants, the Jewish people, for Himself, giving them His Great Name as their portion and heritage. Thus, all Jews are called by His Great Name, HaShem-יהו״ה, which no other nation has any portion in, as the verse states, (Deuteronomy 28:10)  “Then all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name HaShem-יהו״ה is proclaimed over you, and they will fear you,” as another verse states, (Deuteronomy 32:9)  “HaShem’s-יהו״ה portion is His people.”"
31,18,Kabbalah,"Maaseh Rokeach on Mishnah, Seder Moed, Megillah 7","Another correct reason that the erasure of Amalek is 166 words in the Torah and that there are 166 verses in the Scroll of Esther can be said as follows: It is known that Esther is the secret of the Divine Presence, the trait of Kingship (Malkhut) in the secret of, ""and Esther wore royal (malkhut) garments"" (Esther 5:1). And this is the secret of (Chullin 139b:12), ""From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)."" And the word, astir, spelled full adds up to [a numerical equivalent] of 671, like the count of the name, Ado-nai, with its filling (each letter being spelled out), as is known (in the same way that 166 corresponded to an alternative count of the parallel name of God). And in my humble opinion, it appears that it is for this reason that there are ten sections in the Scroll, to complete the number of Esther, [to] Esther 10. For the Scroll is called the Scroll of Esther - and with the additional ten, it adds up to 671, to indicate her virtue, as she was with the secret of the higher Kingship, Ado-nai, with its filling"
31,18,Chasidut,"Peri Tzadik, Purim 4:1","The matter of that which they said (Megillah 6b at the end), ""juxtaposing a redemption to a redemption is preferable,"" meaning the redemption of Egypt to the redemption of Purim: That is since the redemption of Egypt was the beginning of all miracles and the beginning of the revelation of the holiness of Israel in the world. And it was a miracle revealed to the whole world, that God, may He be blessed, chose us as a people and made open miracles which were not in the way of nature. And it was as is stated (Exodus 15:14), ""Peoples heard and they trembled."" The miracle of Purim, however, is called the end of all miracles (as it is said in Yoma 29b), since everything was with great concealment; and it was clothed almost as if it were the way of nature. For it was caused by that which Ahasuerus took Esther and she found favor in his eyes; it was through this that she [was able to] act and subdue Haman and raise up the Jews. And this is [the meaning of] that which they said (Chullin 139b), ""From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)."" And it is like it is found in the holy books, based on this, that the essence of the descent of a person is when it is hidden from him that he is in a state of God hiding his face. And this [is the meaning of] its being stated, ""haster astir,"" that He will hide the hiddenness of His face. And that was the essence of the miracle of Purim. As they were then at the lowest level, when the Jewish people felt that they were in a state of the greatest hiddenness - as it is stated (Esther 4:3), ""there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and lamenting."" And, as is known, the matter of mourning and lamenting indicates something that is final in a person's mind; that its hope is already lost. And it is like the matter of mourning and lamentation about a dead person, since there is no way to bring him back. But because they felt the hiddenness of God's face, the mourning flipped into a joyful day. And this is [the meaning of] that which they said (Megillah 11a), ""When did all 'the ends of the earth see the salvation of our God?' In the days of Mordechai and Esther."" And the intention about that which is stated (Psalms 98:3), ""all the ends of the earth have seen,"" is not about the nations of the world. For they did not see the salvation of our God, since it was clothed and close to being the way of nature, as mentioned above. And that which it is stated (Esther 8:17), ""and many of the people of the land became Jews,"" was only out of fear of the Jews and fear of Mordechai, since they saw that the king elevated him out of respect for Queen Esther. Rather the intention of, ""all the ends of the earth have seen,"" is about the Jewish people, who were then at the lowest point in hiddenness, to the ends of the earth. And it is precise! Through this, they saw the salvation of our God, precisely through this hiddenness! And this matter is strongly present every year on the days of Purim. It should be made known to all the singular Jewish souls that know in the inner recesses of their heart how they are on the lowest level and feel bitter on account of this. With this itself, it becomes known and shines in his heart, that it is flipping for him from despair to joy."
31,18,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:18,"I will conceal My face on that day, in an undefined, future period, because of all the evil that it, Israel, performed as it turned to other gods."
31,18,Quoting Commentary,"Judaism's Life Changing Ideas; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Behukkotai; In Search of the Why 11","This is a remarkable reading and points towards a distinction that we sometimes forget: between divine punishment on the one hand, and the withdrawal of divine providence on the other – what the Torah calls “the hiding of the face” of God. (See Deuteronomy 31:18.)  When God punishes, He punishes the guilty. But when God “hides His face,” even the innocent may suffer."
31,18,Quoting Commentary,"Mekor Mayim Chayim on Baal Shem Tov, Vayeilech 4:2","If a person has complete knowledge and faith that in every concealment and foreign thought G-d’s Presence is hidden, then there is no concealment at all. For the knowledge and faith that the Master of the World – the Divine life-force – is in every movement and thought, both big and small, immediately causes “the workers of iniquity to be dispersed” (Psalms 92:10). The evil falls away and the Divine light and life-force becomes revealed. The Master of the World can be found even in the sins of a totally wicked person, in one who is burning to sin. The only exception is the sin of idolatry, as it is written: “…one he-goat for a sin-offering,” which lacks the letter aleph. (Representing the Alupho shel Olam – the Master of the world.)  A person should think: “How can I make My Creator angry by misusing the very life-force that He gives me, and seeing that He is actually with me? How can I commit this great evil?” One should even partake of permissible desires with a spirit of holiness and humility, and with an awareness of the Divine vitality within them. If you do this, you will easily dispel the evil, and become a different person – a holy person who is bound in love to G-d, who experiences true “love of delights” (Song of Songs 7:7). You will easily attain Divine Inspiration, and the spirit of G-d will guide you. Sometimes, however, [the verse applies]: “Hiding, I will hide My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18). Then, the concealment itself is hidden, and a person does not feel any vitality at all. He knows nothing, and forgets that G-d is with him. This happens because he lost his faith and trust in G-d and turned to false gods. At that moment he is subject to Divine retribution. For so long as a person clings to G-d in perfect faith, no evil can befall him at all – only love and affection. Leket Imrei Peninim, p. 206b"
31,18,Jewish Thought,"Tradition in an Untraditional Age, TOPICS, Chapter 7; The Holocaust in Jewish Theology 38","Why the sudden change? The answer was given in different ways by Judah Halevi, (See, e.g., Kuzari, 11, 14, 29–44, V, 22–23.)  Maimonides (See, e.g., M.T. Ta’aniyot 1:1–3, Guide for the Perplexed, II, 36.)  and Nachmanides, (See, e.g., Commentary to Leviticus 18:25. And see, on the general subject, Y. Baer, Galut, New York: Schocken Books, 1947.)  but they converge on a common, if understated, conclusion. Divine Providence governs the affairs of Israel when the Jewish people exist as a sovereign people in the land of Israel. Then there is reward and punishment and prophecy. But exile, diaspora, Galut precisely means being removed from the mercy of God and placed at the mercy of the nations. It means the withdrawal of Providence, what the Bible calls hester panim, the “hiding of the face” of God; what Maimonides calls, being left to chance. (See, e.g., Deuteronomy 31:18, Isaiah 8:17, 64:6, Ezekiel 39:23-24. Maimonides, M.T. Ta’aniyot 1:3, Guide for the Perplexed, III, 36.) "
31,18,Jewish Thought,"Tradition in an Untraditional Age, TOPICS, Chapter 11; Alienation and Faith 5","Our isolation, in contrast, belongs to our times, a time when, it would seem, even the hiddenness is hidden. A story about the Baal Shem Tov explains the nature of double concealment. It is said that one day on a journey he met a child who was crying, and when he asked him why, the child said: I was playing with my friends, and I was to hide. But I have hidden myself so well that they cannot find me. This, it is said in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, is God’s situation. To hide one’s face is to seek to be found; but when one is so hidden that even the fact that one exists in hiding, is hidden, (The Baal Shem Tov’s remark is based on the verse (Deuteronomy 31:18) “And I will surely hide (haster astir) My face.” The repetition of the verb is taken to refer to a double concealment, that is, when the hiddenness itself is hidden. See Toledot Yaakov Yosef, parshat Bereshit.)  then the separation is of a tragic order."
31,18,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:18:1,"ואנכי הסתר אסתיר, “and I will hide Myself even further;” our sages derive from this line that the Purim story i.e. the scroll of Esther and Mordechai are of Biblical authority [Esther’s real name having been Hadass, Ed.] i.e. that even during periods of exile when we do not feel the presence of G–d around us, He nonetheless watches over us and intervenes in our fates decisively when we are under attack. [Although His name does not even appear in that scroll, Haman did not succeed in killing a single Jew. Ed.]"
31,18,Talmud,Chagigah 5b:2,"With regard to the verse: “And I will hide my face in that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18), Rava said that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Even though I hid my face from them and My Divine Presence is not revealed, nevertheless: “I speak with him in a dream” (Numbers 12:6). Rav Yosef said: His hand is outstretched, guarding over us, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of my hand” (Isaiah 51:16)."
31,18,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 42:3,"Another interpretation, “it was in the days of Amrafel” – Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: The following exposition was brought with us in our hands when we came up from the Diaspora: (When the exiles of Israel returned to the land of Israel with Ezra from Babylon.)  Wherever it is stated: “It was [vayhi] in the days,” it indicates trouble. (Vayhi is seen as a combination of the words vay and hi, both expressions of woe and misfortune.)  “It was in the days of Amrafel” – what was the trouble there? “They waged war” (Genesis 14:2). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: There are five such instances. (For the other four instances, see: Isaiah 7:1; Jeremiah 1:3; Ruth 1:1; Esther 1:1.)   This is analogous to a friend of a king who lived in a certain province, and for his sake the king took an interest in that province. Once some barbarians came to attack him, and they said: ‘Woe unto us, as the king will not show favor to the province as was his wont if they kill his friend.’ That is what is written: “They turned back, and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7) – Rabbi Aḥa said: They came only to fight against the eyeball [ein] of the world; (Abraham is called the eyeball of the world, because it was only for his sake that God took an interest in and looked out for the benefit of the people of the world.)  they sought to blind the eye [ayin] that overcame the attribute of justice [mishpat] in the world. “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rav Aḥa said: Hu is written. It is he [hu] who sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace. When the barbarians came to attack him, everyone began crying out: ‘Woe [vay].’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days of Amrafel.”  “It was in the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). (Israel was under attack from all sides.)  This is analogous to a king’s son, whose caretaker resolved to kill him. He said: ‘If I kill him, I will be liable to execution by the king. Instead, I will take away his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own.’ So, too, Aḥaz said: ‘If there are no kids, there will be no goats, and if there are no goats there will be no flock, and if there is no flock there will be no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, there will be no world.’ (That is, the world will not be able to function in its conventional manner.)  That is what Aḥaz thought to himself: ‘If there are no children [in school], there will be no students, if there are no students there will be no scholars, if there are no scholars there will be no elders, if there are no elders there will be no prophets, if there are no prophets the Holy One blessed be He will not rest His Divine Presence upon them [Israel]. (Consequently, he closed all the schools.)  That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).  Rabbi Ḥonya bar Rabbi Elazar said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he locked up [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Isaiah said: ‘“I will hope for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no moment that was as grim as that time, in whose regard it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But at that very time, I [Isaiah] hoped for Him, as it is written [immediately afterwards]: “For it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). (When God said that He would hide His face from Israel, He continued, that nevertheless the Torah would never be forgotten by them.)  Of what use was it to him [Ahaz]? (Despite his best efforts, the Torah continued to be taught, as the Midrash goes on to explain.)  [Of no use, as Isaiah declared:] “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord gave me, are to become signs and wonders in Israel”’ (Isaiah 8:18). Were they (The young men Isaiah was referring to.)  his children? Were they not actually his students? However, we learn from here that they [his students] were as beloved to him as sons. When he [Aḥaz] locked up the synagogues and study halls, people began crying out: ‘Woe [vay]’ – “it was [vayhi] in the days of Aḥaz.”  “It was in the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? [It was as Jeremiah prophesied:] “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to a king who sent a proclamation throughout the province. What did the residents of one province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. Thus it is stated: “It happened that as Yehudi would read three or four sections…” (Jeremiah 36:23) (It was the Book of Lamentations that was being read.)  – this means three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse, “Its besiegers have become dominant” (Lamentations 1:5) – “He cut it up with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). When everyone saw this, they began crying out: ‘Woe [vay]’ – “it was [vayhi] in the days of Yehoyakim.”  “It was in the days that the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) (A more literal translation would be, “in the days of the judging of the judges.”)  – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). This is analogous to a province that owed a tax to the king. The prince sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do to him? They took him and beat him. They then said: ‘Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these events; what he sought to do to us, (Subdue us.)  we did to him.’ So, too, in the days of the judging of the judges – when a person of Israel would engage in idol worship, and the judge sought to implement against him the attribute of strict justice, (And decree for him corporal punishment.)  he would come and flog the judge. He said: ‘What he sought to do to me, I did to him.’ (“The judging of the judges” is interpreted to mean that the people committed acts of judgment and punishment against their judges.)  They said: ‘Woe [vay] to the generation that judges its judges.’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).  “It was in the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [Haman’s decree:] “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate [all the Jews]” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a certain vineyard, and three enemies rose up against it. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began cutting off the clusters, and the third began uprooting the vines. So too, Pharaoh [said]: “Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). Nebuchadnezzar [exiled] “the ḥarash and the masger, (These are two classes of Torah scholars (Gittin 88a).)  one thousand” (Jeremiah 29:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: One thousand ḥarash and one thousand masger; the Rabbis said: They were one thousand altogether. Haman sought to uproot the entire vineyard, as it is stated: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews…” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began crying out: ‘Woe [vay].’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days of Aḥashverosh.”  Rabbi Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that vayhi is stated it refers either to trouble or to joy; if the context is one of trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is one of joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and made a distinction: Everywhere that vayhi is stated, (Even when it is not connected with “in the days of.”)  it alludes to trouble, and vehaya [alludes to] joy.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “And there was [vayhi] light”? (Genesis 1:3). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as the world was not privileged to use that light. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, He hid it away for the righteous in the future. That is what is written: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light, growing brighter until the day is established” (Proverbs 4:18).  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day”? (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wear away, as it is stated: “For the heavens will vanish like smoke and the earth will wear away like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6).  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8), “…a third day” (Genesis 1:13), “a fourth day” (Genesis 1:19), “a fifth day” (Genesis 1:23), “a sixth day”? (Genesis 1:31). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete [joy], as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires some act [to perfect it], e.g., mustard requires sweetening, wheat requires grinding, and lupines require sweetening.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph”? (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as that bear (Potifar’s wife.)  then accosted him.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day, Moses summoned”? (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as Nadav and Avihu died [that day].  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle”? (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That was nevertheless not [complete] joy, as it was hidden away with the building of the Temple. (Moses’ Tabernacle was stored away forever when the permanent Temple was built.)   They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua”? (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That was nevertheless not [complete] joy, as it became necessary for him to rend his garments. (Joshua 7:6.)    They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] when the king (David.)  resided in his house, and the Lord had given him respite…”? (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: It was nevertheless not complete joy, as Natan then came and said to him: “However, you will not build the House…for My name” (I Kings 8:19).  They said to him: We have said our [arguments], now you say yours. He said to them, (To prove his contention that vehaya always alludes to a joyous event.)  is it not written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge…” (Zechariah 14:8). It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man will keep a calf of the herd…” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be on that day that the Lord will continue…[to acquire the remnant of His people]” (Isaiah 11:11). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, a great shofar will be sounded…” (Isaiah 27:13).   They raised an objection to him: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: That was nevertheless joyous, as on that day, Israel gained atonement for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel gained great atonement for their iniquities on the day that the Temple was destroyed, as it is stated: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion, He will not continue to exile you again” (Lamentations 4:22)."

31,18,Jewish Thought,"Crisis and Covenant; Jewish Thought after the Holocaust, Chapter 2; The Valley of the Shadow 45","Yet another dimension of Jewish thought spoke about the divine withdrawal from history not as a timeless feature of human freedom but as a specific phase in the history of the covenant. The Torah speaks of the “hiding of the face” of God. But it does so in a particular context, namely the exile of Jews from their land. From the opening chapters of Genesis to the closing speeches of Deuteronomy, human transgression is seen in terms of dislocation, moral and physical. Adam and Eve are exiled from Eden. Moses warns that if the children of Israel sin they too will be exiled. This in turn deepens the alienation between man and God, until man experiences God in His absence, not His presence. “Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them, so that they will say in that day: ‘Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?’ And I will surely hide My face in that day…” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18.)

31,19,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:19:1,"AND NOW WRITE YE THIS SONG. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, He commands both Moses and Joshua to write it for He wanted to make Joshua His prophet during Moses’ lifetime. Now, Moses wrote it while Joshua stood by him, read it, and saw [it completed], this being the sense of the verse, So Moses wrote this Song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. (Further, Verse 22.)  It refers to Moses who was the principal [in the writing of the Song] for it was from him that they would hear it and learn it, although Joshua, too, taught it with him, as it is stated at the conclusion [of the chapter] he [i.e., Moses], and Hoshea, the son of Nun. (Further, 32:44.)  Now, the meaning of the expression this Song is “the Song that I will now tell you,” this being ‘Ha’azinu’ (Give ear). (Ibid., Verses 1-43.)  It is called Song because Israel would recite it with song and psalm. (At the Divine Service in the Sanctuary, a section of the Song of Ha’azinu was chanted each Sabbath during the Service of the Additional Offering. The cycle of the Song was completed every six weeks. Therefore, the six divisions (Aliyoth) in the reading of this Song in the Synagogue on the Sabbath of Ha’azinu, follow the same divisions as sung in the Sanctuary (Rosh Hashanah 31a).)  It was also written [in the Torah] in the style of a song, since songs are written with interruptions [empty spaces] indicating the places of chanting."

The verses are to be read as follows: Now…write ye this song…that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel (v. 19), For when I shall have brought them into the land… The song that is being discussed in these verses is the song in the following chapter.)  It is also possible that our verse is independent, (In other words, our verse is not tied to the verse that follows.)  because Scripture states, ve-anetah (that…shall testify) (v. 21). (In this case, verse 20 opens a new thought and is tied to verse 21. The verses are to be read: For when I shall have brought them into the land…(v. 20) that this song shall testify before them (v. 21).)  Ve-anetah (that…shall testify) is similar to ta’aneh (bear) (That is, testify.

31,19,Halakhah,Sefer HaChinukh 613:1,"For everyone to write a Torah scroll for himself: That we were commanded that each man in Israel must have a Torah scroll (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandments 18). If he wrote it with his [own] hand, this is praiseworthy and very dear; and as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Menachot 30a), “If he wrote it” — meaning to say, with his hand — “Scripture attributes [it] to him as if he received it from Mount Sinai.” But one who is unable to write with his hand must pay someone to write it for him. And about this it is stated (Deuteronomy 31:19), “And now, write for yourselves this poem and teach it to the Children of Israel” — meaning to say, write for yourselves Torah, which contains this poem."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 23:28:1,"B’ETZEM’ OF THIS DAY. The commentators (R’dak in his Sefer Hashorashim, (Book or Roots), root etzem.)  have said that the meaning of this phrase is “in this selfsame day.” Similarly, and ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears until ‘etzem’ this day (Above, Verse 14.)  means “until this selfsame day.” So also, ‘uch’etzem’ the heaven for clearness (Exodus 24:10.)  means “the very” heaven. But we cannot interpret that the word b’etzem here alludes to the essence and power of this day (And in that case the verse would be stating: “You shall do no manner of work in the essence of the day, meaning at daytime.” That interpretation would be incorrect, as the text continues.)  [which is at daytime], just as our Rabbis have said with reference to the verses: ‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah … into the ark (Genesis 7:13.)  [which the Rabbis interpreted to mean (Sifre, Ha’azinu 332.)  that because the neighbors threatened to kill him and destroy the ark should they see him entering it, therefore G-d told him to enter it ‘b’etzem’ of this day — in broad daylight]; ‘b’etzem’ of this day the Eternal did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt (Exodus 12:51.)  [which the Rabbis similarly interpreted (Sifre, Ha’azinu 332.)  “in broad daylight,” because of the previous threats of the Egyptians not to let them go — such an interpretation we cannot assume here], for it is written, and ye shall afflict your souls, in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even. (Further, Verse 32. Thus it is clear that the prohibitions affecting the Day of Atonement commence on the evening before the actual day.)  Similarly, And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a holy assembly (Above, Verse 21.)  [stated with reference to the Festival of Weeks] includes the night as well. Now He did not mention this phrase ‘b’etzem’ of this day with reference to the Sabbath nor the festivals, except for the Festival of Weeks and the Day of Atonement, and so also in the prohibition of chadash (the new produce) (When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the omer at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered chadash (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).)  He said until ‘etzem’ of this day. (Above, Verse 14.)  The reason for this appears to be that since He had said of the Festival of Weeks, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving … ye shall number fifty days, (Ibid., Verses 15-16. Thus one might think that the observance of the festival depends on the doing of the acts prescribed for it, whereas the real meaning is: “from the day that you are to bring” etc. irrespective of whether they can be brought or not, as when the Temple is destroyed.)  and then He stated, and ye shall present a new meal-offering … Ye shall bring out of your dwellings, (Ibid., Verses 16-17.)  etc., and dealt at length with the commandments of the offerings [in Verses 17-20], therefore it was necessary to state, And ye shall make proclamation ‘b’etzem’ of this day a solemn assembly; (Above, Verse 21.)  meaning that the very day is holy and the doing of work is forbidden on it, and it is not dependent upon the sheaf [of the waving brought on the second day of Passover], nor on the offerings. Similarly in the case of the Day of Atonement, since He had said, and ye shall afflict your souls, and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal, (Ibid., Verse 27.)  and in the section of Acharei Moth (Above, Chapter 16.)  He made the [complete] expiation dependent upon the offerings and on the goat sent [to Azazel], (Ibid., Verse 22.)  therefore it was necessary to state here, And ye shall do no manner of work on that very day, for it is a day of atonement in itself to make atonement for you, besides the expiation effected by the offerings. Similarly, until ‘etzem’ of this day (Above, Verse 14.)  said in connection with the new produce [means that the prohibition of eating from the new produce continues] up to that very day, which is the day ye have brought the offering of your G-d, (Above, Verse 14.)  thus stating that even if the [meal-] offering [of the new barley] has not been brought, the commandment applies to that very day — so that the new produce (When the Sanctuary stood, the offering of the omer at any time on the sixteenth day of Nisan at once rendered chadash (the new crop) permissible food. Since the destruction of the Sanctuary, the prohibition extends to the whole day of the sixteenth of Nisan (Rosh Hashanah 30 a-b; see also “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 186-188).)  is forbidden before that day and is permissible afterwards. This is the sense of His saying, it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings, (Above, Verse 14.)  as I have explained. (Above, Verse 16.)  We further find that Scripture mentions this phrase ‘b’etzem’ of this day in the case of events which have been decreed to come at certain set times. Thus it says of Noah, ‘b’etzem’ of this day entered Noah etc.; (Genesis 7:13.)  [and in case of the exodus it says,] And it came to pass ‘b’etzem’ of this day that all the hosts of the Eternal went out from the land of Egypt; (Exodus 12:41.)  [and when Moses was ordered to ascend Mount Nebo it says,] And the Eternal spoke unto Moses ‘b’etzem’ of that day, saying: ‘Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto Mount Nebo.’ (Deuteronomy 32:48.)  The reason for this expression in these [three] cases is that it is possible to think that Noah had brought into the ark beforehand many of the beasts and fowls [and on the selfsame day that he finished bringing them into the ark, he himself came in]; likewise it is possible [to think] that some Israelites had left Egypt before that time and on that day the exodus was completed, and so also that the command for Moses our teacher’s ascension was given before that day, and on that day he actually went up. Therefore Scripture explained in all these [three] cases that [the particular events referred to in the verses] all took place on these selfsame days, not that they were started before and finished on those days, but they all happened [completely] on these very days. Similarly, ‘b’etzem’ of this day was Abraham circumcised, (Genesis 17:26.)  means that many people were circumcised in one day, the verse thus stating Abraham’s zeal in observing the commandments. It further appears to me that the expression “the etzem” of any thing means “its power and strength,” the term being derived from the verses: my power ‘v’otzem’ (and the might) of my hand; (Deuteronomy 8:17.)  strength ‘v’tha’atzumoth’ (and power). (Psalms 68:36.)  So also, One dieth ‘b’etzem tumo’ (Job 21:23.)  means “in the fulness of his strength.” And since the bones form the structure of the body and its strength, they are so called [atzamoth — from the word otzem, strength]. Thus ‘k’etzem’ the heaven for clearness (Exodus 24:10.)  means that the purity of that which they saw [at Mount Sinai] was clear and strong, even as is a pure clear heaven. It is for this reason that He mentions about those specific days [of festivals referred to above] the expression etzem hayom, in order to indicate that these matters specified are of the very essence of the days, not because of other things added to them, namely the offerings brought on those days. And so also did Onkelos translate [the word etzem as] “bikran of that day,” which [literally] means “‘in the horn’ of that day,” [i.e.,] in its essence and in its strength, the word bikran being related to these expressions: and all ‘karnei’ (the horns) of the wicked will I cut off; (Psalms 75:11.)  my shield ‘v’keren’ (and the horn of) my salvation; (II Samuel 22:3.)  for since the strength [of the animal] is in its horns, therefore the substance of a thing is called karno [“its horn” — its strength or essence]. In the language of the Sages we find: (Terumoth 7:1.)  “He pays the keren (the principal value) but he does not pay the [added] fifth.” And some texts of Onkelos have bichran [with a chaph instead of bikran with a kuph], but it is all one, for in Scripture kova and chova both mean hat, (I Samuel 17:38 (kova); 17:5 (chova). See Vol. I, p. 506, where Ramban mentions this princuple briefly, that the kuph and the kaph (or chaph) are often interchangeable.)  and the Sages always make use of the term akava written with a kaph [meaning “staying”], which is derived from the expression, ‘v’lo y’akveim’ [written with a kuph, and meaning: and He stayeth them not] when His voice is heard. (Job 37:4.)  The Rabbis also say mithkasheit [with a kuph] (Tosephta, Kethuboth 7:3. See my Hebrew commentary p. 156, Note 73.)  from the word tachshitin [with a chaph, meaning “ornaments”]. They further say: “If ants kors’muha” [with a kuph, meaning “nibbled” the crop], (Peah 2:7.)  of the root: the boar out of the wood ‘y’chars’menah’ [with a chaph, meaning: doth ravage it]. (Psalms 80:14.)  And those other places where the expression ‘b’etzem’ of this day is mentioned also mean: “in the strength of that day,” for they were matters which in the normal course of events could not happen in one day. Therefore Scripture stated that all the beasts and all the cattle and all the fowl and all creeping things upon the earth were gathered by “the power” of that day, by the decree of G-d upon them, for it was His mouth that commanded and the breath thereof it hath gathered them. (Isaiah 34:16.)  Similarly, six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children (Exodus 12:37.)  cannot be gathered together and go out as one man from the land of Egypt [all in one day], only by the strength of the day which was so decreed upon it by word of the Supreme One. And so also in the case of Moses our teacher, this expression [‘b’etzem’ of this day] is intended to teach that on the day he was commanded to write this song, and teach it the children of Israel, put it in their mouths, (Deuteronomy 31:19.)  and he finished speaking all these words, (Ibid., 32:45.)  it was decreed upon him that he go up by the power of that day in which the Divine decree was given, to Mount Abarim, and then he said the section of ‘V’zoth Habrachah’ (And this is the blessing) (Ibid., Chapter 33.)  and afterwards he went up to the mountain — all these activities being matters which would usually take many days, but they were all done by the power and strength of the day. Similarly, that three hundred and twenty men (Three hundred and eighteen were the trained men in the house of Abraham (Genesis 14:14). Together with Abraham and Ishmael there are three hundred and twenty.)  should be circumcised in one day in the house of Abraham was a thing that proceeded from G-d. Now the prophet Ezekiel said, they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, to ‘etzem’ this day, (Ezekiel 2:3.)  in order to include that very day in this group. So also the expression until ‘etzem’ of this day (Above, Verse 14.)  of the prohibition of the new produce, means “until and inclusive of this day” [i.e., on the sixteenth of Nisan it is also forbidden to eat of the new produce, before the bringing of the meal-offering of the new barley], for the essence of a thing is its power and strength. And our Rabbis have interpreted the expression ‘b’etzem’ of this day used in connection with the festivals, to mean (Torath Kohanim, Emor 14:7.)  “on the day itself,” that is to say, from the time the stars appear until they come out on the following night, thus excluding the additional time which the Sages have deduced must be added from profane unto holy [i.e., before the actual beginning of the festival, and after its actual end]. And in the cases of Noah, and the exodus from Egypt, and Moses’ [death], they interpreted that phrase to mean “in the strength of the day,” [that is] mid-day, as is stated in the Sifre, (Sifre, Ha’azinu 332.)  and Rashi wrote it in the section of Ha’azinu. (Deuteronomy 32:48.) "
31,19,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 19:7:1,"AND MOSES CAME AND CALLED FOR THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE, AND SET BEFORE THEM ALL THESE WORDS. This means that he said to them: “Behold, I have presented before you the words [of G-d]. Choose you this day (Joshua 24:15.)  if you will do so.” Therefore, they answered him, All that the Eternal hath spoken we will do. (Verse 8.)  This is similar in meaning to the verse: See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, (Deuteronomy 30:15.)  and also: And these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them, (Further, 21:1.)  meaning that they are to say if they choose to observe them and accept [them] upon themselves. It is for this reason that it says there, And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Ibid., 24:3.)  Similarly, And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:44.)  means that Moses asked the generation that was to come into the Land whether they would accept the Torah upon themselves, for he was about to make a covenant with them in the plains of Moab, just as he had done with their fathers in Horeb. (Ibid., 28:69.)  And the Gaon Rav Saadia (Mentioned here in Ibn Ezra. On Rav Saadia Gaon, see Seder Va’eira, Note 229.)  said that the expression, and he set before them, is similar in meaning to the expression, put it in their mouth, (Deuteronomy 31:19.)  [this being a reference to the Oral Law, which is the commentary to the Written Law]. But the correct interpretation is only as I have explained. And all the people answered together. (Verse 8.)  This also means that Moses called together the elders of the people, who are their wise men and their judges, for theirs is [the power of] choice. And he set before them all these words in the presence of the whole congregation, since it was with reference to all the people that G-d had commanded, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel. (Above, Verse 3.)  But they did not wait for the counsel and decision [of the elders, but readily], all the people answered together — both small and great (II Kings 23:2.)  — and said, All that the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Verse 8.)  And so it says again, and all the people answered with one voice, and said: All the words which the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Further, 24:3.) "
31,19,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Numbers 23:5:1,"AND THE ETERNAL PUT A WORD IN BALAAM’S MOUTH. Some commentators (I have not identified these commentators. See, however, my Hebrew commentary, p. 294, Note 22, for a similar opinion found in the Zohar.)  explain that Balaam did not understand the words [he said], but G-d filled him with words and said to him: “Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak, (Verse 5.)  for the words will come forth [automatically] from your mouth.” Perhaps this is also the opinion of our Rabbis, who have said: (Tanchuma, Balak 12; Bamidbar Rabbah 20:16.)  “He shaped his mouth and formed it [so that he would speak as He desired], like a person who fixes a nail onto a board. Rabbi Eleazar says: It was an angel that spoke: Rabbi Yehoshua says: etc.” (“It was the Holy One, blessed be He, that spoke through the mouth of Balaam” (ibid.).)  But it does not appear to me to be correct [that Balaam did not know what he was saying], because he said [that he] heareth the words of G-d; seeth the vision of the Almighty. (Further, 24:4.)  But the meaning of [the word] ‘vayasem’ (and He put) is “instruction,” signifying He taught him the words so that he should recite them with his mouth, and he should not forget or omit any part of it, similar to [the expression], teach thou it the children of Israel; ‘simah’ (put it) in their mouths. (Deuteronomy 31:19. This means: let them know the words of this song by heart (Ibn Ezra).)  Similarly, for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been ‘sumah’ (‘put; determined’). (II Samuel 13:32.)

31,19,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Genesis 48:20:2,"וישם את אפרים לפני מנשה, he did this not physically, but by mentioning Ephrayim’s name in the blessing ahead of the name of Menashe. The expression (verb) שימה, or לשום respectively can be used with words (intangibles) as well as with people and tangible objects. A prominent example of it being applied to intangible concepts is Exodus 21,1 ואלה המשפטים אשר תשים לפניהם, “and these are the laws, judicial concepts, you are to place before them.” Or. In Deuteronomy 4,41 וזאת התורה אשר שם משה, “and this is the Torah which Moses placed, etc.” The reference was not to the Torah scroll, but to what was written in it. Also in Deuteronomy 31,19 the line שימה בפיהם, does not refer to something being placed in the mouth of the people, such as food, but it refers to the words in the written Torah being fed to the people as if food fed through their mouths.

31,19,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 7:1","It is a positive commandment (Sefer HaMitzvot (Positive Commandment 18) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 613) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.)  for each and every Jewish man (With this expression, the Rambam excludes women and minors. The Sefer HaChinuch (loc. cit.) explains that although this mitzvah is not associated with a specific time, since women are not obligated to study Torah, they are also not required to fulfill this mitzvah. Note the Sha'agat Arieh (Responsum 35), who objects and obligates women in this mitzvah.)  to write a Torah scroll for himself, as [implied by the commandment (Deuteronomy 31:19)]: ""And now, (Although this command was addressed to Moses, the fact that the plural form of the word ""write"" is used indicates that the command was addressed to the entire people.)  write down this song (the song Ha'azinu)  for yourselves,"" (The above is a quote from Sanhedrin 21b. The Talmud, however, does not explain how this verse serves as a commandment to write a Torah scroll. The following interpretation is the Rambam's.)  i.e., write down the [entire] Torah which contains this song. [The basis for this interpretation is] that the Torah should not be written passage by passage. (See Halachah 14.)  Even if a person's ancestors left him a Torah scroll, it is a mitzvah to write one himself. (The Sefer HaChinuch (loc. cit.) explains that this was intended so that there would be many Torah scrolls available to allow everyone the opportunity to study. Alternatively, a person will be far more motivated to study in a new scroll which he produced himself.)  If a person writes the scroll by hand, it is considered as if he received it on Mount Sinai. (Taking the effort to write the scroll oneself indicates that, had the person lived at the time the Torah was given, he also would have joined the Jews in traveling to Mount Sinai to receive it (Nimukei Yosef, Menachot).)  If he does not know how to write (a scroll according to all the particular halachic requirements)  himself, [he should have] others write it for him. (i.e., he should hire a scribe or purchase a Torah scroll. Menachot 30a states: ""A person who purchases a Torah scroll in the public market is like someone who grabs a mitzvah in the marketplace."" Rashi maintains that purchasing a Torah scroll fulfills a mitzvah, but the mitzvah is not as complete as if one had written the scroll oneself. The Ramah, however, states (Yoreh De'ah 270:1) that if a person merely purchases a Torah scroll without checking it, he does not fulfill the mitzvah at all. Note the statements of the Tevuot Shor, which explain that if another person can perform a mitzvah in a more complete manner than one is able to do oneself, it is preferable to commission him to do so as one's agent. In this instance, since most people cannot write a Torah scroll as attractive and halachically accurate as a professional scribe, it is preferable to hire the latter to write one's scroll.)  Anyone who checks even a single letter of a Torah scroll is considered as if he wrote the entire scroll. (Unless the scroll is checked, it cannot be used (See Halachah 12). Checking also involves effort. In his Hilchot Sefer Torah, Rabbenu Asher explains that, at present, this mitzvah is also fulfilled by writing chumashim, texts of the Talmud, and other books of Torah law. This concept is also quoted by the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 270:2). The Turei Zahav (270:4) explains that Rabbenu Asher's intention was not that there is no longer a mitzvah in writing a Torah scroll (for it is impossible that a change in circumstance will nullify a Biblical command), but that the original mitzvah has been extended to include these other texts. Since even according to Rabbenu Asher's view, there is a mitzvah for each person to write a Torah scroll for himself, it is difficult to comprehend why we do not see many individuals trying to fulfill this mitzvah. This question is particularly pertinent in light of the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the list of positive commandments in Sefer HaMitzvot, where he describes the writing of a Torah scroll as a mitzvah which a person is obligated to fulfill. It is possible to explain that since many people are not capable of actually writing a Torah scroll themselves and do not have the financial resources to purchase one and check it, they fulfill this mitzvah through purchasing letters in a Torah scroll written by the community (Pit'chei Teshuvah 270:1; Likkutei Sichot, Vol. 24).) "
31,19,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Eiruvin 5:12","Our Rabbis taught: ""What was the method of learning the traditional Torah in the days of Moses? Moses learned it from the mouth of God, then Aaron entered and Moses taught him the chapter; when Aaron had finished, he left the seat of study, taking a seat at the left of Moses, and then his sons entered. Moses then taught them the chapter. When they finished, they departed, Elazar assuming a seat at the left of Moses and Ithamar at Aaron's right. R. Juda says: 'Aaron was always at the right of Moses.' The elder then entered and Moses taught them the same chapter. When the elders were through, they departed and the people entered and Moses taught them the chapter. Thus it is found that Aaron studies the chapter four times, his sons, three times, the elders twice, and the people once. Moses then departed and Aaron studied the same chapter with them all. When Aaron finished, he departed, and his sons studied the chapter with them; after the sons finished, they departed and the elders studied the chapter with the people. It is thus found that every one repeated the chapter four times. 'From this.' says R. Eliezer, 'we learn that it is the duty of a man to repeat a lesson with his disciple four times.' For if Aaron who learned it from Moses and if Moses, who learned it from God Himself, had to repeat the chapter four times, then, surely, an ordinary man who learns from another ordinary man, should repeat it much more frequently."" R. Akiba said: ""Whence do we infer that a man must learn the lesson with his disciple until his disciple knows it? It is said (Deu. 31, 19.) And teach it the children of Israel. Whence do we know that he must teach him until he knows it? It is said (Ib. ib. ib.) Put it in their mouths. Whence do we infer that the he must show him the reasons for every law? It is said (Ex. 21, 1.) And these are the laws which thou shouldst place before them."" Why should not all enter and learn directly from Moses? In order to show honor to Aaron, his children and the elders. If that be so, then why should not Aaron enter and learn it from Moses, Aaron's children from Aaron, the elders from Aaron's children, and the people from the elders? Because Moses learned from the Almighty, he was therefore more capable of explaining the Torah. The master said above: R. Juda says ""Aaron was always sitting to the right of Moses."" In accordance with whose opinion is the following Baraitha? ""When three men are walking on the road the teacher shall walk in the middle, the junior disciple to his right and the senior to his left."" Is this not in accordance with B. Juda [who says Aaron was sitting at the right of Moses]? We can say it is in accordance even with the opinion of the Rabbis, yet Aaron occupied his seat to the right of Moses in order to save him trouble [as he occupied the seat at the right of Moses in the beginning, so he remained]. "
31,19,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Eiruvin 5:14","R. Chisda said: ""Knowledge of the Torah can be acquired only through means of signs; for it is said (Deu. 31, 19.) Put it in their mouth. Do not read it Sima (put it) but read it Simana (its signs)."" When R. Tachlipha heard this in the West (Palestine), he told it to R. Abuhu, who said: ""Ye derive it from that passage, but we derive it from the following (Jer. 31, 20.) Set thyself up waymarks, i.e., set up way-marks to the Torah."" Whence do we know that the word Tziyun means marks? For it is written (Ez. 39, 15.) Then when anyone seeth a human bone, he will set up a 'Tziyun' around it."" R. Elazar said: ""[We know it] from the following, (Pr. 7, 4.) And call understanding thy kinswoman, i.e., make a kins-woman of the Torah."" Raba said: [This means] ""Set a fixed regular (Fol. 55a) time for the study of the Torah."" This also is intended by R. Abdimi b. Dosa, who spoke thus: ""What is meant by the passage (Deu. 30, 12.) It is not in heaven, neither is it beyond the sea. It is not in heaven means that even if it were in heaven, one would have to ascend to reach it; neither is it beyond the sea, i.e., even if it were beyond the sea, one would have to cross the sea to reach it."" Raba said: ""It is not in heaven, means that knowledge cannot be found in him who exalts himself [in wisdom] as high as the heavens; Neither is it beyond the sea, means that neither is it with him who considers his opinion as broad as the sea."" R. Jachanan said: ""It is not in heaven, means that it cannot be found among presumptuous men; Neither is it beyond the sea, means that it cannot be found among travelling merchants and tradesmen.""

Thus the Holy One Blessed be He to Moses: Before you charge Me over My sons, charge them over Me, that they not cheapen Me and that they not exchange My honor for foreign gods.

31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Exodus 19:7:1","וישם לפניהם. “He presented it before them in clear terms, etc.” According to Ibn Ezra, Moses did this verbally. Some people claim that Moses presented all this to the people in book form.     Rabbeinu Saadyah gaon, says that the meaning is similar to שימו בפיהם, (Deut 31,19) where it means that G’d had asked Moses to make the people thoroughly familiar with His admonitions.     Nachmanides says that G’d (Moses) told the people: “I have set out all these precepts for you to choose if you undertake to take these obligations upon yourselves.” The people responded by saying that everything G’d had said they were willing to carry out, just as is reported in Exodus "
31,19,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:19:1","ועתה כתבו לכם את השירה הזאת, “and now write down for yourselves this song;” Nachmanides writes that the plain meaning is that G’d commanded this to Moses while Joshua heard G’d’s instructions, and read what Moses wrote down. This is the meaning of verse 22 where Moses is reported as writing all this down and teaching the people the contents of that ”song.” Joshua joined in teaching the people, as we know from The “song” that is referred to is the first section of Parshat Haazinu. The reason that this portion is called שירה, song, or poem, is that since time immemorial the Jewish people recite it as such.

31,19,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 306:15,"Variantly: ""Hear, O heavens, etc."": Moses appointed over Israel two witnesses (heaven and earth) that live forever, telling them: I am flesh and blood; tomorrow I will die. If they wish to say that they never received the Torah, who will come and refute them? Therefore, He appointed for them two witnesses that live forever. And the Holy One Blessed be He made this (Ha'azinu) song a witness, viz. (Devarim 31:19) ""so that this song be for Me a witness in the children of Israel."" He said: The sun will be witness for them below, and I, above. And whence is it derived that G-d is called ""a swift witness""? From (Malachi 3:5) ""And I will draw near to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness,"" and (Jeremiah 29:23) ""and I am the one who knows and bears witness,"" and (Michah 1:2) ""and the L-rd G-d will be a witness against you."""
31,19,Talmud,Eruvin 54b:14,"Rabbi Akiva says: From where do we derive that a person is obligated to teach his student until he learns the material and understands it? As it is stated: “Now therefore write this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). This verse indicates that one must teach Torah to others. And from where do we derive that one must teach his students until the material is organized in their mouths?

31,19,Talmud,Nedarim 38a:6,"The Gemara cites an additional verse: “Now therefore write this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). Apparently, Moses was commanded to teach the Torah to the Jewish people. The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to the song of Ha’azinu (Deuteronomy 31) alone and not to the rest of the Torah. The Gemara asks: But the continuation of that cited verse: “That this song may be a witness for Me among the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19), indicates that the reference is to the entire Torah, in which the mitzvot are written. Rather, the Torah was given from the outset to all of the Jewish people, and when Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that the Torah was given exclusively to Moses, he was referring merely to the profound analysis of the Torah. Moses opted to teach it to the people on his own initiative."

Abaye raised an objection to him from a baraita concerning the king’s Torah scroll: And he writes himself a Torah scroll for his sake, so that he does not beautify himself with the Torah scroll of others.

Even a person who inherits a Seifer Torah from his father, is commanded to write one for himself. If someone hires a soifer (scribe) to write a Seifer Torah for him, or if he buys it and finds that it is defective, and corrects it, this is considered as though he had written it.

As Rabbi Joshua ben Levi says,  ""One who buys a [ready made] Torah Scroll is like one who grabs a mitzvah in the market place."" [On the other hand] One who writes it himself or corrects even one letter is counted as if he received it directly from Mt. Sinai. It goes without saying that he shouldn't sell his Torah, even if he has many, and it is even forbidden to sell an old scroll in order to buy a new one, or even [to buy food]. However it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll in order to learn Torah or to get married if he has nothing else to sell. My master, my father, the Ro""sh, of blessed memory, wrote that this was written only for the earlier generations, who would write a Torah scroll and learn from it. But nowadays, when we write a Torah scroll and leave it in the synagogue to read from it publicly, it is a positive mitzvah incumbent on all Jews who have the means to do so to write [copies] of the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Gemara and their commentaries, and to study from them - him, and his sons. For the mitzvah of writing a Torah is in order to learn from it, as it says: (Deut. 31:19) ""and teach it to the people of Israel, place it in their mouths."" And through the Gemara and its explanation, one will know the explanation of the mitzvot and the laws with clarity.

31,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:19:2,"You will find that Moses complied with these instructions as we find in verse 22 that he wrote down the song and taught it to the Israelites.

Gd said to him, 'I want to give it to them in writing, but it is revealed before me that in the future the nations of the world will rule over them and take it away from them.

The achronim disagree as to whether according to Rosh there is no longer a commandment to write a Torah Scroll, which is the view of Prishah and Shach, or whether the original commandment is still in force but today there is an additional mitzvah to copy the other books, which is the opinion of Beit Yosef and Taz. All agree, however, that Rosh ruled that there is a positive commandment to write copies of the other books. The difficulty is that when the Torah was given at Sinai it was forbidden to transcribe the Oral Torah, as stated in Gittin 60b, ""you are not permitted to write things that were spoken."" How could there be a commandment to write what was forbidden to be written at the time the commandment was given? The answer must be that once written, the Oral Torah acquired the status of Written Torah."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part II 6:3","[These two approaches] are expressed in the verse, “If you search for her [Torah knowledge] as silver, and if you hunt for her as hidden treasures, then you shall understand the fear of the Lord….” (Prov. 2:4, 5.)  This means that in earlier generations, one who merited to acquire Torah knowledge needed to search out the halachah through rigorous analysis of the passage, like one who toils in order to extract silver that is embedded in base metals that are found in its locale [that is, related to the context of the passage], as well as to search for treasures that are not found in its locale [that is, not related to the context of the passage]. After this, [the scholar] was required to arrange the laws [he had derived] in a well-organized manner. This is taught in the Mechilta on the parashah of Mishpatim: “‘[These are the laws] that you shall set before them.’ (Ex. 21:1.)  This teaches us that the laws should be set before [the people of Israel] as a set table.” This is also taught in Tractate Eruvin 54b, where it states, “[How is it known that a teacher should teach his students so] that it is well organized in their mouths? [As the verse states, ‘Place it in their mouths….’”]. (Deut. 31:19. The entire text of the verse is, “Now write this song for yourselves and teach it to the Children of Israel to place it in their mouths, in order that this song will be a witness for Me against the Children of Israel.”) "
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part II 8:1","THE WISE AND THE “MASTERS OF COLLECTIONS” AFTER KING SOLOMON searched and found that which was concealed within the Written Torah, he began to praise the power of the words of the sages: “The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails are the sayings of the masters of collections….” (Eccl. 12:11.)  According to the simple meaning, [Solomon] is discussing the strengths of the two categories of Torah giants that exist in every generation. Some are referred to as “wise” because they delve deeply into the Torah in order to produce [novel] laws from Scripture and return the lost laws [to us]. (Perhaps this is a reference to laws that were forgotten during the mourning period for Moses. It may also include laws that would be forgotten in subsequent generations.)  There are also “masters of collections” who gather the laws that are scattered throughout the Written Torah and organize them in a proper order. We wrote about this in Chapter 6 regarding the prophet Isaiah’s exhortation to [the scholars of his generation that their learning should not consist of], “a little here, a little there.” Indeed, the Torah [itself] exhorts [us] regarding this as well. As stated in Tractate Eruvin 54b, “From whence is it known that [the Jewish people must toil in the study of the Torah] until it is well organized within their mouths? [From the verse], ‘You shall place it [the Torah] within their mouths.’” (Deut. 31:19.) "
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 5:13","Kindness in this context means that his prayer will be accepted [by God], as indicated by the ending words of the verse, “a prayer to the God of my life.” The simple understanding of the words, “His song is with me,” describes how, when reciting hymns and praise by night, he grasps love and cleaves to the Holy One, blessed be He. [However], R. Simon ben Levi, explains that shira [song] is referring to the song [utterance] of the Torah. As it states in Tractate Nedarim 38a, that the verse “In order that this song will be for Me a witness against the Children of Israel” (Deut. 31:19. The verse reads in full: “Now write for yourselves this song and teach it to the Children of Israel to place it in their mouths, in order that this song will be for Me a witness against the Children of Israel.”)  refers to the entire Torah. [We thus infer that the interpretation of “His song is with me,” is “His Torah is with me,” and King David is stating that by studying the Torah at night], one reaches a level where one’s prayer is accepted by day."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 6:15","However, this can be explained by what is stated in Tractate Nedarim 38a: R. Yosi ben R. Hanina said: “The Torah was given only to Moshe and his seed, for it is written, ‘Write for yourself these words’ (Ex. 34:27.)  [and] ‘Carve for yourself’: (Ex. 34:1.)  just as the carvings [of the Tablets] are yours, so is the writing yours. But Moshe generously gave it to Israel, and concerning him it is said, ‘He who possesses a bountiful eye shall be blessed, etc.’” (Prov. 22:9.)  R. Hisda objected, “[The Torah states]: ‘God commanded me at that time to teach you hukim [statutes] and mishpatim [judgments]?’” (Deut. 4:14. This proves that it was not given to Moshe for himself.)  [R. Yosi answered], “[It should be translated as], ‘He commanded me, and I [passed it on] to you.’” (This is the answer, which interprets the verse as: “And God commanded me at that time [and I determined] to teach you,” etc.)  “[There is a further objection, as the Torah states]: ‘Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me?’” (Deut. 4:5.)  [R. Yosi answered], “He commanded me, and I then taught you.” “[Another objection is that Scripture states]: ‘Now, therefore, write this song for you!’” (Deut. 31:19. “For you” implies that it was given to the Israelites in the first place.)  [R. Yosi answered], “This refers only to the song (This refers to Ha’azinu, Deut. 32:1–43.)  [whereas the rest of the Torah had been given to Moshe alone].” “[But does not “song” refer to the entire Torah, as Scripture states]: ‘This song shall be a witness against the children of Israel’?” (Deut. 31:19. If the reference is to the song alone, how can that testify against Israel?)  “Only pilpul be-alma [the pilpul method] [was given to Moshe alone, and he later taught it to the people].”"
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"From David to Destruction, Editor's Foreword 6","The term “Mishneh” can be rendered in a variety of ways, and is most frequently translated as “second.” According to this interpretation, the king is required to write two Sifrei Torah. While there is a broader national obligation to write a Sefer Torah (Devarim 31:19), a king is obligated to write an additional Sefer Torah. The Gemara (Sanhedrin 21b) elaborates that one Torah is to be held in the king’s treasury, and the other must be kept on his person at all times. The purpose of this constant exposure is explicated by the Pesukim (Devarim 17:19-20):"
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Moses; A Human Life, Introduction 29","Moses’ destiny, it emerges, is to speak in his own singular human voice. Achieving a healing relation between this voice and the divine words is the task of Sinai. The man who, according to the Zohar, has a voice but no speech (kol without dibbur), will, like the poet, reach out to his listeners, “using words to express a moan: ah-ah-ah.” (Marina Tsvetaeva, Dark Elderberry Branch: Poems of Marina Tsvetaeva, trans. Jean Valentine and Ilya Kaminsky (Farmington, ME: Alice James Books, 2012), 32.)  Meaning comes at Sinai. But Torah is, at its heart, poetry. “And now, write for yourselves this song . . .” (Deut. 31:19). (Strikingly, the Talmud (B. Sanhedrin 21b) reads this as referring to the obligation for each individual to write his own copy of the Torah: “Write for yourselves . . .”)  The meanings of the Torah are many; its ultimate passion is direct:"
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Ramban on Genesis, Foreword 2","Upon descending from the mount, he [Moses] wrote the Torah from the beginning of Genesis to the end of the account of the tabernacle. He wrote the conclusion of the Torah at the end of the fortieth year of wandering in the desert when he said [by command of G-d], Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d. (Deuteronomy 31:26.)  This view accords with the opinion of the Talmudic sage who says (Gittin 60 a. The name of the authority is Rabbi Yochanan.)  that the Torah was written in sections. (When a section was declared to Moses, he immediately wrote it down. When all the sections were completed, he compiled them together into one Torah. Rashi, Ibid.)  However, according to the sage who says that the Torah was given in its entirety, (Resh Lakish is the authority who maintains that Moses wrote the whole Torah at one time after all sections had been given to him intermittently during the forty years and were properly systematized in his mind.)  everything was written in the fortieth year when he [Moses] was commanded, Now write ye this song for you and teach it unto the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, (Deuteronomy 31:19.)  and, as he was further instructed, Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d. (Deuteronomy 31:26.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

The term ""wisdom"" is interpreted as a reference to those aspects of Torah study described as Gemara or Talmud (Chapter 1, Halachah 11). At night, when a person is removed from his daytime pressures, he is able to concentrate more on these abstract subjects.)  Therefore, a person who desires to merit the crown of Torah (See the commentary on Halachah 1 with regard to the latter term.)  should be careful with all his nights, not giving up even one to sleep, (Hilchot De'ot 4:4 states that a person should sleep eight hours each night.

Our Sages declared: ""The song of Torah can [be heard] only at night, as [Eichah 2:19] states: 'Arise, sing out at night...’“ (Note the commentaries on Deuteronomy 31:19, which describe the Torah as God's song.)  Whoever occupies himself with Torah study at night will have a strand of [Divine] favor extended over him during the day, as [implied by Psalms 42:9]: ""During the day, God ordains His kindness and, at night, His song is with me, a prayer to the living God."" (Avodah Zarah 3b comments: ""Why does 'God ordain His kindness during the day'? Because 'at night, His song (the Torah) is with me.’“)  [In contrast], any house in which the words of Torah cannot be heard at night will be consumed by fire, as [implied by Job 20:26]: ""All the darkness (i.e., the nights)  is hidden away from His treasures; (the Torah. Therefore,)  a fire that need not be blown will consume him."" [The verse, Numbers 16:31,] ""He scorned the word of God,"" applies to someone who pays no attention to Torah at all. (This is the opinion of Rabbi Natan, as quoted in Sanhedrin 99a, and in the Sifre, Sh'lach.)  Similarly, anyone who has the potential to occupy himself with Torah study and does not, (Sanhedrin, op. cit.) quotes Rabbi Nehorai for this definition of the above verse.)  or who has studied both the Written and Oral Law and turned away to the vanities of the world, leaving behind his study and ignoring it, is included in the category (This definition is not mentioned in any of the opinions quoted in Sanhedrin or the Sifre in the definition of the above verse.)  of ""those who scorn the word of God."" (The Lechem Mishneh emphasizes that this severe condemnation applies even when a person ignores his study out of laziness and idle tendencies, without any contempt or disrespect for the Torah.)  Our Sages declared: ""Whoever neglects Torah study when wealthy will ultimately neglect it amidst poverty. Whoever maintains the Torah in poverty will ultimately maintain it amidst prosperity."" (In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: A person who studies Torah in poverty and need, straining himself to study despite these pressures, will ultimately merit to study amidst prosperity without any disturbances to his study. [Conversely,] a person who neglects Torah study because he is prosperous and, therefore, is busy eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure, will ultimately become poor to the extent that the reason he neglects Torah study will be his pursuit of his daily bread.)  This concept is explicitly mentioned in the Torah [Deuteronomy 28:47-48], which states: ""Because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and good feeling when there was an abundance of everything, you shall serve your enemies,"" (This interpretation of the verse resembles that of Rashi's commentary on the Torah. Note the conclusion of Hilchot Lulav, where the Rambam interprets the verse differently, stressing the importance of serving God with joy.)  and [Deuteronomy 8:16] states: ""so that you shall suffer...so that ultimately He will make you prosper."""
31,19,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 4:4","If the teacher taught [a concept] and it was not grasped by the students, he should not become upset with them (In Hilchot De'ot 2:3, the Rambam explains in detail how ""anger is a very bad trait, and it is proper for a person to separate himself from it entirely."" He continues (ibid. 2:5) explaining how a teacher should instruct the students ""in a composed and pleasant manner, without shouting."" Here, as well, he does not center on the negative aspects of anger in its own right, but rather its impropriety as an educational technique.)  and display anger. (Note the Mishnah, Avot 2:5, cited by the Rambam in the following halachah. Soferim 16:2 states: ""One should teach the Talmud with a pleasant countenance and the aggadah with a patient countenance."")  Rather, he should repeat and review the matter, even if he must do so many times, until they appreciate the depth of the halachah. (Deuteronomy 31:19 states that Torah must be placed in a student's mouth. Eruvin 54b interprets this as a charge to teachers, requiring them to review the subject matter with their students until the latter comprehend it fully. The passage continues, praising Rabbi Pereidah for teaching one of his students each point four hundred times. Though patience is generally required of a teacher, there are times when he should display anger as explained in the following halachah.)  Similarly, the student should not say ""I understood"" when he did not understand. (Derech Eretz Zuta, Chapter 2, states: If you desire to study, Do not say ""I have comprehended it,"" when you have not.)  Rather, he should ask again and again, even if he requires several repetitions. (The teacher's patient devotion to his students must be reflected by them. They must dedicate themselves to understanding their teacher's words and steadfastly apply themselves to their study until they comprehend.)  If his teacher becomes upset with him and displays anger, he should tell him: ""My teacher, this is Torah. It is necessary that I study, and my powers of comprehension are weak."" (Megillah 28a relates that Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi gave such a reply to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah after the latter impatiently rebuked him for what seemed an irrelevant question.) "
31,19,Halakhah,"Tur, Yoreh Deah 270:2","It is a mitzvah incumbent on every Jewish man to write a Torah scroll, and it is extremely important to seek [an opportunity] to perform it. As Rabbi Joshua ben Levi says,  ""One who buys a [ready made] Torah Scroll is like one who grabs a mitzvah in the market place."" [On the other hand] One who writes it himself or corrects even one letter is counted as if he received it directly from Mt. Sinai. It goes without saying that he shouldn't sell his Torah, even if he has many, and it is even forbidden to sell an old scroll in order to buy a new one, or even [to buy food]. However it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll in order to learn Torah or to get married if he has nothing else to sell. My master, my father, the Ro""sh, of blessed memory, wrote that this was written only for the earlier generations, who would write a Torah scroll and learn from it. But nowadays, when we write a Torah scroll and leave it in the synagogue to read from it publicly, it is a positive mitzvah incumbent on all Jews who have the means to do so to write [copies] of the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Gemara and their commentaries, and to study from them - him, and his sons. For the mitzvah of writing a Torah is in order to learn from it, as it says: (Deut. 31:19) ""and teach it to the people of Israel, place it in their mouths."" And through the Gemara and its explanation, one will know the explanation of the mitzvot and the laws with clarity. Hence these are the books that a person is commanded to write and also not to sell unless it is [to raise the money] to study Torah or to a marry a woman."

31,19,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:19,"Now, in light of the events to come, write this song for you, the song that appears later on (32:1–43), which is called the song of Haazinu , after its opening word, and teach it to the children of Israel, place it in their mouths. They shall write down this song and familiarize themselves with it until they can recite it, so that this song will be a witness for Me for the children of Israel. The song describes poetically, in highly condensed form, the rise of Israel, their sins, punishments, and redemption. Its poetic style is designed to facilitate remembering its contents throughout the generations."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah, Magid, First Half of Hallel 2:1","THEREFORE IT IS OUR DUTY TO THANK This is one of the transitional moments of the Haggada, when we move from story to song, from prose to poetry, from recitation (Maggid) to praise (Hallel). We have told the story of the Exodus. Now, like the Israelites 3,300 years ago, we sing a song of praise. We lift the cup at this point, fulfilling the words of the Psalm, “I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of God” (Ps. 116:13). Song plays a vital part in Judaism. At the end of his life Moses gave the Israelites the last of the commands – that in every generation we should write a new Sefer Torah. On that occasion he used an unusual word. He called the Torah a “song” (Deut. 31:19). Words are the language of the mind. Music is the language of the soul. Whenever speech is invested with deep emotion it aspires to the condition of song. Thus we do not say our prayers; we sing them. We do not read the Torah; we chant it. We do not study Talmud; we intone it. Each kind of text, and each period of the Jewish year, has its own melody. Thus Moses was saying: to transmit Torah across the generations as a living faith, it must be not just a code of law, but also the song of the Jewish people."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"I Believe; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Vayelekh; How to Renew a Nation 3","There is a different distinction the Sages might have made. Moses gave us 611 commands, and at the very end, in Vayelekh, he gave us two meta-commands, commands about the commands. They are Hak’hel, the command to assemble the people once every seven years for a public reading of (key parts of) the Torah, and “Now write for yourselves this song” (Deut. 31:19), interpreted by tradition as the command to write, or take part in writing, our own sefer Torah."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Studies in Spirituality; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Vayelekh; To Renew Our Days 10","The other command – the last Moses gave the people – was contained in the words: “Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites” (Deut. 31:19), understood by rabbinic tradition to be the command to write, or at least take part in writing, a sefer Torah. Why specifically these two commands, at this time?"
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Lessons in Leadership; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Tzav; On Not Trying to Be What You Are Not 3","The Torah contains four fascinating accounts of such moments. They are linked not by words but by music. From quite early on in ­Jewish history, the Torah was sung, not just read. Moses at the end of his life calls the Torah a song (Deut. 31:19). Different traditions grew up in Israel and Babylon, and from around the tenth century onwards the chant began to be systematised in the form of the musical notations known as Taamei HaMikra, cantillation signs, devised by the Tiberian Masoretes (guardians of Judaism’s sacred texts). One very rare note, known as a shalshelet (chain), appears in the Torah four times only. Each time it is a sign of existential crisis. Three instances are in Genesis. The fourth is in Parashat Tzav. As we will see, the fourth is about leadership. In a broad sense, the other three are as well."
31,19,Quoting Commentary,"Lessons in Leadership; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Nitzavim; Defeating Death 16","And the last command? “Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and make them sing it, so that it may be a witness for Me against them” (Deut. 31:19). This, according to tradition, is the command to write (at least part of) a sefer Torah. As Maimonides puts it: “Even if your ancestors have left you a sefer Torah, nonetheless you are commanded to write one for yourself.” (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Tefillin, Mezuza, VeSefer Torah 7:1.) "
31,19,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:19:1","ולמדה את בני ישראל, “and teach it to the Children of Israel!” G-d is speaking in this way to Joshua.

31,19,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 14:4,"“On the seventh day…” – that is what is written: “The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails are the collectors of wisdom; they were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). It is taught: there was an incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma, who went to greet Rabbi Yehoshua in Pekiin. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: ‘What novel idea was taught today in the study hall?’ They said to him: ‘We are your students and we drink from your water.’ He said to them: ‘Nevertheless, it is impossible for there to be a study hall without a novel idea.’ He asked them: ‘Whose week was it?’ ‘It was the week of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.’ (See Berakhot 28a, where the arrangement that had Rabban Gamliel serving at the head of the yeshiva three weeks a month and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya one week is explained.)  ‘On what was the lecture today?’ They said to him: ‘It was regarding the portion of assembly.’ ‘What did he expound in its regard?’ ‘“Assemble the people, the men and the women and the children” (Deuteronomy 31:12). If men come to learn, and women come to hear, why the children? It is in order to reward those who bring them.’ He said to them: ‘You had this fine pearl in your hands, and you sought to conceal it from me?’  Moreover, he expounded: “You have elevated the Lord this day.… And the Lord has elevated you, this day…” (Deuteronomy 26:17–18) – the Holy One blessed be He said to the Jewish people: You have rendered Me a single entity in the world, as it is written: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4), and I will render you a single entity in the world, as it is stated: “Who is like Your people, like Israel, one nation on earth” (II Samuel 7:23).  He also commenced and taught: “The words of the wise are like goads” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – why are matters of Torah likened to a goad? It is to tell you: Just as this goad directs the cow to its furrows to bring life to the world, so, matters of Torah direct the heart of those who study them from the paths of death to the paths of life. If so, just as this goad is movable, so too matters of Torah are movable? The verse states: “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). If so, just as this nail diminishes and does not expand, (When the nail is removed from the wall, it leaves a hole.)  so, matters of Torah diminish and do not expand. The verse states: “Implanted [netuim]” – just as this sapling [netia] flourishes and multiplies, so too, matters of Torah flourish and multiply. “The collectors of wisdom [baalei asupot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – these are Torah scholars, who sit in many groups [asupot] and engage in Torah study. These rule it ritually impure and those rule it pure; these prohibit and those permit; these disqualify and those rule it valid. Lest a person say: Since these rule it ritually impure and those rule it pure; these prohibit and those permit; these disqualify and those rule it valid, how can I study Torah now? The verse states: “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). One God gave them; one leader said them from the mouth of the Master of all creation, blessed be He, as it is written: “God spoke all these matters” (Exodus 20:1). You, too, render your ears like a funnel and acquire for yourself a heart that hears the statements of those who rule it ritually impure and the statements of those who rule it pure; the statements of those who prohibit and the statements of those who permit; the statements of those who disqualify and the statements of those who rule it valid. He said to them in this formulation: No generation that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya is in its midst, is orphaned.   Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads [kadarvonot]” – Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba said: Just as this goad directs the cow to plow its furrow, so, the words of the wise direct this person to the paths of the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: The Mishna called it marde’a, and the Bible called it darvan and malmad, as it is written: “A cattle goad [malmad]” (Judges 3:31), and likewise, “and to set the goad [darvan]” (I Samuel 13:21). Rabbi Natan said: Why is it called marde’a? It is because it imparts knowledge [moreh de’a] to the cow. Why is it called darvan? It is because it causes understanding to reside [dar bina] in the cow. Why is it called malmad? It is because it teaches [melamed] the cow to plow in its furrow. The same is true of the words of the wise; they cause wisdom to reside in people, impart knowledge in them, and teach them the ways of the Holy One blessed be He. “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – they are implanted in a person when he observes them. Why are they likened to a sapling [netia]? Just as the roots of a tree take root everywhere, so the words of the wise enter and take root throughout the body. “The collectors [asupot] of wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when are they like implanted nails in a person? It is when a master of Torah enters to teach, and they gather [ne’esafim] to hear.   “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – on the first day of the festival, Rabbi Yoḥanan would recite the blessing: Blessed are You, Lord our God, who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us regarding the taking of the palm branch [lulav]. The rest of the days: Regarding the mitzva of the elders. Rabbi Yehoshua would recite the blessing: Regarding the taking of the lulav, each day. Does Rabbi Yehoshua not concede to Rabbi Yoḥanan that the first day is an obligation by Torah law, as it is stated: “You shall take for you on the first day…” (Leviticus 23:40), and the rest of the days are by rabbinic law? Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: That is what Rabbi Yehoshua holds. Why, then, did he do so? It is because it is written: “The words of the wise are like goads…they were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – matters of Torah law and matters of rabbinic law were given from one shepherd.  “More than that, my son, be careful: Making many books without end, and much contemplation is weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). “More than that, my son, be careful” – more than regarding matters of Torah law, be careful regarding matters of rabbinic law. Likewise it says: “As your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2) – the words of the beloved are better than the wine of Torah. Why? It is because one cannot issue halakhic rulings properly on the basis of matters of Torah, because it is vague, and it consists entirely of symbols, as it is stated: “Teach it to the children of Israel; place it [sima] in their mouths” (Deuteronomy 31:19), symbols [simanim] in their mouths. However, from statements of the Sages one can issue halakhic rulings properly, because they explain the Torah. That is why the statements of the Sages are likened to darvanot, because they cause wisdom [medayrin bina] to reside in people.  Another matter: “More than that, my son, be careful” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – Rabbi Abba of Sadronanya said: Were a person to say to you: Why were the statements of the scribes not given written, just as the matters of Torah were given; say to him: It is because it is impossible to write all their statements. That is what is written: “More than that [mehema], my son, be careful.” What is mehema? What [ma] enters you if you come to write the statements of the scribes? Why? It is because were you to write their statements, there is no limit or end to the statements that would enable producing books. That is what is written: “Making many books without end” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). What, then, shall a person do? He shall greatly exert [meyage’a] his flesh to contemplate [lahgot] the statements of the Sages. That is what is written: “And much contemplation [velahag] is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12).  Another matter: “And much contemplation [is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh]” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – if you exerted [yagata] yourself greatly in their statements, the Holy One blessed be He will remove the evil inclination from you. That is what is written: “Flesh,” just as it says: “[I will give you a new heart…and I will remove the stony heart from your flesh]; I will give you a heart of flesh” (Ezekiel 36:26).  Another matter: “And much contemplation [velahag] is weariness [yegiat] of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – if you exerted [yagata] yourself greatly in contemplation of the statements of the Sages, the Holy One blessed be He will herald you good tidings [besorot]. That is, “flesh [basar].”  Another matter: If you exerted yourself greatly in the statements of the Sages, you become like a ruler [basar]; that is what is written: “Flesh [basar]” (Ecclesiastes 12:12). Likewise, it says: “Through me [bi] rulers rule [sarim yasoru]” (Proverbs 8:16).  Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads [kadarvonot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen said: A girl’s ball [kadur shel banot], like the sphere that children catch and throw from here to there. The statements of the Sages are the same; this states his reason and that one states his reason. Is it, perhaps, that because this one states one reason and that one says a second reason, perhaps their words are ephemeral? The verse states: “And like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). It did not say “and like fixed nails,” but rather, “implanted.” Why? It is because he made them like nails, and a nail that has a head is easier to extract. That is why it said: “Like implanted nails.” Roots of a tree that are planted are difficult to uproot. Why are their statements likened to a nail? It is because an iron nail that has a head, even though it is hard, it is easy to extract, and the roots of a tree that are planted even though they are difficult to extract, but they do not have strength like the strength of iron. That is why it is stated: “Like implanted nails”; matters of Torah were accorded the strength of iron and are like the planted roots of a tree.  Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen ben Rabbi said: We read it masmerot, (With the letter samekh.)  but it is written only masmerot. (With the letter sin.)  Just as the priestly and Levite watches [mishmarot] are twenty-four, so the books (Of the Bible.)  are twenty-four. It juxtaposed the statements of the scribes to matters of Torah, that they, like them, are true.  Another matter: “And like [implanted] nails [ukhemasmerot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – masmerot is written; just as the priestly watches are twenty-four, so too, the nails are twenty-four. The question is asked: How many nails need there be in the sandal? (So it would be permitted to wear it on Shabbat.)  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Five, corresponding to the five books of the Torah. Rav Huna said: Seven, as it is stated: “Iron and bronze your padlocks, and all your days, shall be the flow of your oil” (Deuteronomy 33:25). (Your bronze nails in your sandals shall be like your days, seven.)  Rav Aḥa expounded in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Nine. Rabbi would allot eleven on this side and thirteen on that side, the number of priestly watches.   Another matter: “Like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – you affix this nail, and even though you then extract it, its place is recognizable; so, anyone against whom the Sages extend their hand, even if they subsequently accepted him, ultimately he will receive his just deserts at their hand.   Another matter: “Like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when matters of Torah emerge properly from the mouths of their promulgators, they are pleasing to their listeners. “Like implanted nails [kemasmerot]” – when they emerge distorted, they are bitter for their listeners; “kemasmerot” – items that dissolve and are bitter [kemas marot].  “The collectors [asupot] of wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – when are matters of Torah implanted in this person? It is when their masters are taken [ne’esafim] from them. As long as his teacher is alive, he could be distracted and say: Whenever I need, my teacher is available to me and I can ask him. When his teacher dies, he must toil day and night to sustain his studies. He knows that he has no one to ask. That is, when is it that they are implanted in this person? It is when their masters are taken [ne’esafim] from them.   “They were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – even though this one states his reason and that one states his reason, the statements of this one and that one, all of them were given from Moses, what he received from the single One of the universe.  Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – it is taught: From where do you say that if a person heard a matter from an insubstantial one of Israel that it should be in his eyes as though he heard from a Sage of Israel? The verse states: “It will be if you hear My commandments that I command you today” (Deuteronomy 11:13), not as one who hears from the mouth of a Sage, but rather, as one who hears from the mouths of Sages, as it is stated: “The words of the wise are like goads.” Just as this goad directs the cow to its furrows to bring life to the world, so, matters of Torah direct the knowledge of a person to know the Omnipresent. And not as one hears from the mouths of Sages, but rather as one who hears from the mouths of Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “Collectors of wisdom [asupot]” (Ecclesiastes 12:11). Asupot is nothing other than Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16). And not as one who hears from the mouths of Sanhedrin, but rather, as one who hears from the mouth of Moses, as it is stated: “Were given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11), as it is stated: “And His nation remembered the days of old, Moses” (Isaiah 63:11), and it says: “And Moses shepherded” (Exodus 3:1). And not as one who hears from the mouth of Moses, but rather as one who hears from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Were given from one shepherd.” “Shepherd of Israel, listen” (Psalms 80:2) – “one,” as it is stated: “The Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).   It says: “[Your neck is like an ivory tower;] your eyes are pools in Ḥeshbon, by the gate of Bat Rabim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus” (Song of Songs 7:5). “Your eyes” – these are the elders, who are appointed over the congregation. Likewise it says: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and He closed your eyes; [He covered the prophets and your leaders, the seers]” (Isaiah 29:10). (It refers to their leaders as “eyes.”)  “Pools” – just as this pool, a person does not know what is in it, so, a person cannot reckon the statements of the Sages. “In Ḥeshbon” – as their conclusions are drawn through counsel and thought [maḥshava]. Where are these conclusions drawn? It is in the study halls at the gate of Bat Rabim. (Traditionally the courts, including the judges and their disciples, would assemble at the city gates.)  “Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus” – if you fulfill the Torah, aspire to Elijah, to whom I said: “Return on your path to the wilderness of Damascus.” And it says: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant.… Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet…” (Malachi 3:22–23).  “More than that, my son, be careful” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – the Holy One blessed be He said: I have written for you twenty-four books, be careful not to add to them. Why? “Making many books without end” (Ecclesiastes 12:12) – anyone who reads a verse that is not from the twenty-four books, it is as though he read the books of heretics. That is, “be careful making many books,” as anyone who does so has no share in the World to Come. That is what is written: “Without end,” just as it says: “But you, go to the end […at the end of the days]” (Daniel 12:13). (End here is taken to refer to the time of salvation. One who is not worthy of salvation does not merit the World to Come.)  You see what is the punishment of one who adds a book. From where is it derived that one who contemplates them becomes wearied  from them? “And much contemplation is weariness of the flesh” – as the flesh will not be roused from the dust, like what we learned: These have no share in the World to Come…and one who reads heretical literature. (Sanhedrin 90a.)   Another matter: “The words of the wise are like goads, and like implanted nails” (Ecclesiastes 12:11) – just as this nail that is implanted in the door sustains the boards, so, when the righteous issue a decree, the Holy One blessed be He fulfills their words. Know that it is so from Jacob, as when he blessed Manasseh and Ephraim, he had the younger precede the elder, and the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled his decree. In his regard it is stated: “The words of the wise are kadarvonot” – do not read it as kadarvonot, but rather as kadrabanut, as, when Jacob decreed that the authority [rabanut] would be with Ephraim, the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled his words like an implanted nail. The Holy One blessed be He said: Since Jacob decreed regarding Ephraim that he would be first, I too will place him first regarding all matters: regarding judges, regarding banners, regarding kings, and regarding offerings. Regarding judges, (Judge in the sense of leader, as it is employed in the book of Judges.)  Joshua, as he was a judge: “For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun” (Numbers 13:8); and thereafter, Gideon son of Yo’ash, who was from the tribe of Manasseh. Regarding the banners, “the banner of the camp of Ephraim” (Numbers 2:18), and then, “with it is the tribe of Manasseh” (Numbers 2:20). Regarding kings, Yerovam son of Nevat was from Ephraim, and then Yehu son of Nimshi, from Manasseh. The offerings of the princes, too, when they came to present their offerings: Ephraim presents his offering first, on the seventh day, and Manasseh later, on the eighth day. Accordingly it says: “On the seventh day, prince of the children of Ephraim” and then, “on the eighth day, prince of the children of Manasseh"" (Numbers 7:54). In his [Jacob’s] regard, the verse states: “You will decide something, and He will fulfill it for you” (Job 22:28)."
31,19,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Introduction 9","Taz, Yoreh De'ah 270:4, concedes that Perishah's understanding of Rosh's position is entirely compatible with the text but declares that Bet Yosef's analysis must nevertheless be correct ""for how can the commandment 'And now write unto yourselves' be abrogated with the passing of generations?"" For that matter, Taz' objection may be raised with regard to Bet Yosef's interpretation as well. The biblical commandment is couched in the words ""And now write unto yourselves this song"" (Deuteronomy 31:19). The term ""song"" (shirah) is understood as referring to the Pentateuch. If so, the mizvah is clearly defined as requiring the copying of a specific text referred to as ""this song."" How, then, is it possible for this term, ""with the passing of generations,"" to come to denote much more than the text of the Sefer Torah?"
31,19,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Introduction 11","The difficulties associated with the position of Rabbenu Asher may be resolved if it is assumed that this authority translated the term ""song"" as denoting literally the Torah in its entirety. Indeed, the Gemara in three instances, Hagigah 12b, Nedarim 38a and Hullin 13b, clearly interprets the word ""song"", both in this and in other contexts, as a reference to the Pentateuch in its entirety. (For an illuminating explanation of why the Torah is termed a “song” see R. Naphtali Zevi Yehudah Berlin, Ha‘amek Davar, Introduction.)  Thus, according to Rosh, a literal reading of Deuteronomy 31:19, yields an obligation to transcribe the full text of the Pentateuch."
31,19,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Introduction 12","However, the term ""song"", interpreted as meaning Torah, is not limited to denotation of the Written Law exclusively. Megillat Ta'anit, chapter 4, presents a highly significant interpretation of the concluding phrase of this very verse, ""and teach it to the children of Israel, place it in their mouths."" Megillat Ta'anit explains that the phrases ""teach it to the children of Israel"" and ""place it in their mouths"" are not at all synonymous expressions. Rather, ""teach it"" refers to the ""song"" of the immediately preceding phrase, i.e., the Written Law, while the phrase ""place it in their mouths"" is understood as a reference to the Oral Law which must be ""placed in the mouth"" since it may only be transmitted orally. (Cf., R. Yitzchak Ze’ev Soloveitchik, Ḥiddushei Maran Riz ha-Levi al ha-Torah (Jerusalem, 5723), p. 16a. See also the commentary of Ba‘al ha-Turim, Deuteronomy 31:19.) "
31,19,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 60:1:6,"In our opening Midrash, Rabbi Meir takes the view that wine, -because it causes confusion of the mind-, is unwholesome. Rabbi Yehudah, on the other hand, holds that far from confusing the mind, wine confers blessings upon those who drink it; it improves the digestion, temperament etc. when consumed in moderation. The Bible is full of quotations attesting to the virtues of wine. As the wine cellar is open to all who wish to buy, so Sinai was open to all who wished to learn Torah, to help them control the urge to let the demands of the flesh dominate, a tendencey that has existed since the first sin in Eden. This is why the Talmud (Yevamot 103) claims that the Israelites who stood at Mount Sinai divested themselves of the impurities ingested by man in Eden, due to the serpent. For this reason too, our sages in Sanhedrin 90, say that all of Israel has a share in the world to come. If the Talmud in Sanhedrin 90, had meant that every Jew, whether religious or secular has eternal life, that would be unfair discrimination against the gentiles, and would make the life of the pious Jew unrewarding. The sinner could then look forward to the same destiny. Also, the second statement in that Mishnah, which lists a number of exclusions to the general rule, would contradict the first statement. Therefore, the correct understanding of the statement is that the term ""Israelite"" is not applied to someone who is merely of Jewish parentage, but to someone who lives up to the expectations of Judaism. It refers to Jews who live in accordance with the lessons learned at Sinai. Such a person is assured of eternal life. Therefore we understand the word ""Israelite"" as a righteous person, and conversely, ""a righteous person"" is an ""Israelite."" When the Mishnah goes on to adduce scriptural proof for its statement, the quotation ""and your people who are all righteous will inherit the earth for all future times,"" makes perfect sense. We read in Tzefaniah 3,13, ""the remnant of Israel will not commit iniquities."" This seems to presuppose that it is possible to bear the name Israel, and yet commit all kinds of sins? When Tzefaniah talks about the ""remnant"" however, he refers to those who, though they share the Jewish tradition, are not necessarily aware of Torah. We see that Moses distinguishes between two sets of Jews. (Deut. 33,4) ""Moses commanded us Torah, a hereditary tradition to the community of Jacob."" The elite of the people are familiar with Torah and its details; the multitude treasures tradition handed down as such, but without deeper knowledge of same. Acquiring new habits is difficult, unless a satisfactory rationale is provided. Continuing a long established tradition does not make intellectual demands on those who practice them. The men of the great assembly may have been called such, because due to the cessation of activities by the prophets, it fell to their lot to make certain innovations to insure the continuance of Judaism as we know it. They established their claim to fame by three things. (Mishnah Avot 1) They advised moderation in the application of justice, searched for a concensus. 2) They tried to put Torah on a broad base, by enrolling many students in the academies; and once having done these two things, 3) they were able to construct ""fences"" around Torah, and have those ""fences"" respected by the people at large. If the interpretation of the Mishnah would be the standard one, i.e. that of ""be circumspect before deciding legal matters,"" a later statement at the end of the chapter, that ""justice is one of the pillars of the world,"" should have appeared before the statement in the name of Shimon Hatzaddik. The latter had been a member of the men of the great assembly, and was also the author of the opening statement of the first Mishnah. Having understood the function of the men of the great assembly, we can now understand the statement of the Talmud in Avodah Zarah 35, which interprets the verse ""your friendship is dearer than wine"" (Song of Songs 1,1) to mean that the Midrashic interpretations of Torah are dearer to Israel than the original text, even. The general order in which forbidden foods are listed, is such that the intake of animals that the Torah considers as only mildly damaging, is listed first, whereas those foods that the Torah considers as severely harmful to the development of the ideal Jewish personality, are listed later. The very fact that animals which are poisonous, or any plants that are poisonous are omitted in the list, clearly shows that the Torah's concern in this legislation is not our physical health. "

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,20,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:20:1","VV. 20 u. 21. כי אביאנו וגו׳ והיה וגו׳. Die beiden Verse bilden ein Satzgefüge. Dass der Abfall mit seinen Folgen bevorstehe, ist VV. 16-18 ausgesprochen. Hier wird nun gesagt, welche Wirkung die שירה für die zu erwartende Zukunft haben werde. Wenn nun die eben vorausgesehene Zukunft, der Abfall und die Leiden, eingetroffen sein wird, dann וענתה וגו׳. Mit ואכל ושבע ודשן, wird aber noch der Umstand entüllt, aus welchem der Abfall – trotz der תורה und שירה – hervorgehen wird, so daß תורה und שירה den Abfall wohl heilen, nicht aber verhindern werden, und dieser Umstand ist: die aus dem Überfluss sich erzeugende sinnliche Üppigkeit. Das geistig sittliche Regime, mit welchem die תורה auch die sinnliche Leiblichkeit des Menschen heiligend umschränkt, behagt einer überwuchernden üppigen Sinnlichkeit nicht. Ihr sagt das Heidnische, die Ungebundenheit eines die Sinnlichkeit vergötternden Götterkults viel mehr zu, dem gegenüber das im Gottesbunde zu findende sittliche Lebensglück seinen Wert verliert (ונאצוניsiehe Bamidbar 14, 11), und so bricht es den Gottesbund. Mit diesem ואכל ושבע ודשן ופנה ist die Klippe bezeichnet, an welcher wiederholt Israels Treue und damit Israels Glück gescheitert; hier, in der Gott und seinem Gesetze in Glück und Überfluss zu bewahrenden Treue, liegt die Aufgabe, deren endliche, wirkliche Lösung auch heute noch erst einer Zukunft angehört, die dann für die endliche unverlierbare Erlösung gereift sein wird. Dann erst wird das Glück bei uns einkehren, ohne unsere Pflichttreue gegen Gott und sein Gesetz zu gefährden, dann wird aus dem Schoße eines reichgesegneten Zustandes nur eine um so vollere, durch keine Beschränkung gehinderte oder verkürzte Verwirklichung der von Gottes Gesetze gestellten Aufgaben hervorgehen. Daher wird oben Kap. 30, 8-10 in der Verheißung dieser endlichen Zukunft nach der durch Rückkehr zur Gesetzestreue (V. 8) zu erzielenden Rückkehr eines reich gesegneten Glücks (V. 9) die Rückkehr zur Gesetzestreue in noch erhöhtem vollerem Maße (V. 10) wiederholt, als eine Errungenschaft, die dann durch das wiedergekehrte Glück nicht gefährdet, vielmehr zu ewiger vollendeter Entfaltung gelangen wird.

Wie tief auch sein Fall und wie weitab seine Verirrung, eins wird unter allen Wechselfällen ihm bleiben, eins es durch die dunkelsten Gänge seiner Leiden begleiten, und das ist: die תורה.

31,20,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:20:4","Sanhedrin 90b wird in V. 16 – das וקם auch hinaufgelesen: הנך שכב עם אבתיך וקם eine Andeutung der einstigen Auferstehung der Toten, תחית המתים, gefunden. Nach Joma 52 b wäre dies eine der fünf Stellen, die hinsichtlich eines Wortes (von den Akzenten abgesehen, ריטב׳׳א daselbst) es unentschieden ließen, ob es hinauf oder hinunter zu lesen wäre, חמש מקראות בתורה שאין להן הכרע, nämlich: שאת ארור מחר משוקדים וקם (Bereschit 4, 7; daselbst 49, 7; Schmot 17, 9; daselbst 25, 34; Dewarim 31, 16), und zwar wäre nach ׳תוספו daselbst damit die Frage gestellt, die betreffenden Worte entweder nur hinauf oder hinunter zu lesen, nicht aber, wie z. B. Wajikra 25, 37, siehe daselbst, die Worte auch als zu dem Vorhergehenden und Nachfolgenden gehörig zu interpretieren. Diese von תוספו׳ wiederholt gegebene Auffassung bietet erhebliche Schwierigkeiten, da auch, von den Akzenten abgesehen, nur die beiden Stellen Schmot 17, 9 u. 25, 34 ein solches Entweder-Oder zulassen, Bereschit 4, 7 aber die Konstruktion ein Lostrennen des Wortes von dem Vorhergehenden ebenso wenig gestattet, wie daselbst 49, 7 oder in unserer Stelle ein Lostrennen des Wortes von dem Nachfolgenden. וקם in unserer Stelle nur hinaufgelesen, bliebe ja העם הזה völlig ohne Prädikat. Man wäre daher versucht, das אין להן הכרע dahin zu verstehen, daß die Frage wäre, ob das betreffende Wort nur zu einem der Sätze oder nicht vielleicht als zu beiden gehörig zu interpretieren, unsere Stelle daher entweder nur וקם העם הזה oder auch הנך שכב עם אבתיך וקם וקם העם הזה zu lesen wäre. In der Tat scheinen auch ר׳ יהושע und ר׳ שמעון בן יוחאי Sanhedrin 90b das וקם als zu הנך שוכב und zu העם הזה gehörig zu interpretieren: מנין שהב׳׳ה מחיה מתים ויודע und תורת חיים .מה שעתיד להיות שנא׳ הנך שוכב עם אבותיך וקם העם הזה וזנה מהר׳׳שא ח׳׳א erklären diese Stelle Sanhedrin 90b abweichend von תוספו׳ in diesem Sinne. (Ohnehin gestatten wir uns zu bemerken, daß ר׳ יהושע ebenso wie ר׳ אלעזר המודעי auch hinsichtlich der Stelle Schmot 17, 9 nicht איסי בן יהודה׳s Ansicht ist. Siehe מכילתא daselbst, weshalb auch eine Nichtübereinstimmung hinsichtlich der anderen Stellen möglich, und sich auch dadurch die von תוספו׳ ישנים Joma 52b ד׳׳ה וקם bemerkte Schwierigkeit lösen dürfte.)

31,20,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:20:5","Vergegenwärtigen wir uns den ganzen Inhalt der mit V. 16 eingeleiteten Enthüllung von Israels nächster und fernster Zukunft, so dürfte eine diesen einleitenden Worten eingeschlossene Hindeutung auf die Auferstehung der Toten einen tiefinnigen Zusammenhang mit diesem Inhalt bieten. Wie das leibliche Sterben eines Menschenindividuums kein ewiger Tod ist, vielmehr dem scheinbar für immer erstorbenen Leibe ein nicht in die Verwesung mit eingehendes Etwas bleibt, von dem aus der einstige Gottesruf die Auferstehung gestaltet: so führen alle Grabesgänge des jüdischen Volkes nur scheinbar zu dessen ewigem Völkertode. אני ישנה ולבי ער. Es scheint einen Todesschlaf zu schlafen, aber sein Herz bleibt wach.

31,20,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:20,"For I will bring them to the land with regard to which I took an oath to their forefathers, which is a land flowing with milk and honey, and there they will eat, and will be satisfied, and they will grow fat, as the nation will be prosperous, and they will turn to other gods, and will serve them, and scorn Me, and will breach My covenant."
31,20,Talmud,Berakhot 32a:12,"On a similar note, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said that Rav Sheshet said: That is what people say in a popular maxim: Filling his stomach is a type of sin, as it is stated: “When they were fed and became full they were sated, and their hearts were lifted and they have forgotten Me” (Hosea 13:6). Rav Naḥman said: This principle is derived not from the verse in Hosea, but from here: “And your heart is lifted and you forget the Lord” (Deuteronomy 8:14). And the Rabbis say that this principle is derived from here: “And they will have eaten and been sated and fattened, and they will turn to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:20)."
31,20,Second Temple,Book of Jubilees 1:10,"And do thou write for thyself all these words which I declare unto thee this day, for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck, before I bring them into the land of which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: ""Unto your seed will I give a land flowing with milk and honey"
31,21,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:21:1,"FOR I KNOW THEIR INCLINATION WHICH THEY HAVE SHOWN THIS DAY. The meaning thereof is like the expression, for now I know that thou art a G-d-fearing man, (Genesis 22:12.)  which is knowledge become actualized, for knowledge of the future is knowledge in potential. (See Ramban ibid., (Vol. I, p. 279).)  Now, if Israel had not sinned in the wilderness and the recognition of his temperament had not been actualized, it would have been inappropriate for him to testify against them in the Song, saying that it is known to Him that you will sin and therefore I call [heaven and earth] to witness that many evils and troubles (Verse 17.)  like such and such will come upon you. Instead it would have been proper that He give them the Torah with unspecified foreknowledge: If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land; but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword. (Isaiah 1:19-20.)  But now, that their bad temperament and their straying heart (Ezekiel 6:9.)  had become known to them as well, He told them all that would occur to them. This is similar to what is said, Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew etc., therefore I have declared to thee from of old; before it came to pass I announced it to thee. (Isaiah 48:4-5.) "
31,21,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:21:1,וענתה השירה הזאת לפניו לעד [AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS …] THAT THIS SONG SHALL TESTIFY that in it I had warned them concerning all the things that had befallen them.

31,21,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:21:1,BEFORE THEM. Le-fanav means before them. It means that the witness will not be removed from before them but shall always be with them. (Israel shall always have a copy of the song with them.) 
31,21,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:21:2,"FOR I KNOW THEIR IMAGINATION. For even if I did not know the future, (Supernaturally.)  I know what they have done until this day. (And on this basis can surmise how they will act in the future.) "

31,21,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 31:21,"And when these many evils and troubles shall come upon them, then will this hymn bear witness to them for a testimony; for it is revealed before Me that it will not be forgotten on the lips of their children: for their evil disposition to which they are yielding today, even before I bring you into the promised land, is known to Me.

31,21,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:21:1,"כי ידעתי את יצרו אשר הוא עושה היום, for I, G’d, know its nature, its character; they do not look forward to taking over the land of the Canaanites in order to serve Me, as I wanted them to and hoped they would do. (compare Psalms 105,44-45 “He gave them the lands of nations; they inherited the wealth of peoples; in order to observe His statutes and His teachings, and observe His laws.”) Instead they look forward to gratify their own cravings as a result of which their excess wealth will be the cause of their decline and corruption, as per 32,15 “Yeshurun waxed fate and kicked, etc.”"
31,21,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 22:5:1,"כי תצא אש, If fire escapes (from someone's private domain), etc. The Torah means that even if one lights a fire in one's own private yard such a person is liable for damage caused by such fire outside his domain if the blaze was such that the owner should have foreseen it could extend beyond his own fence. If an individual lit a fire in his private yard which could not be expected to extend beyond his own boundaries he is free from responsibility if it happened unexpectedly. Such an accident would have to be considered an act of G'd (compare Baba Kama 61). When the Torah speaks about ומצאה קוצים, that the fire ""finds thorns,"" it means that even if there were no other inflammables in its path, the fact that the stack of corn is consumed by fire results in the person starting the fire having to make repayment, שלם ישלם. He will have to pay for either the stack of corn or the field in which the corn is still growing, as the case may be. He will even have to pay for the stalks though the latter were a contributing cause to the corn being burned. All of this applies only if the fire ""found"" the thorns. If a person other than the one who started the fire contributed to its spreading, then that second person is liable for the entire damage which occurs as a result."
31,21,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 27:2,"For twenty-eight days, he was groaning and crying out to the mountain (Isaiah 22:5). It is also said, ""In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon"" (2 Kings 25:8). Elsewhere it says, ""On the tenth day of the month"" (Jeremiah 52:12). It also says, ""In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar"" (Jeremiah 52:29). What does it mean by nineteen? And what does it mean by eighteen? Nineteen refers to the reign, and eighteen to the capture of Jehoiakim. What does it mean by the seventh day of the month? And what does it mean by the tenth day of the month? If we say on the tenth, why also say on the seventh? From now on, know that on the seventh, the nations entered the temple and took the sea, the bronze vessels, and the pillars. They were groaning on the seventh, eighth, and ninth until the day turned (Lamentations 1:14). At dusk, they lit a fire in it, and it was burned on the tenth of the month. Of that generation, it is said, ""For I know his inclination"" (Deuteronomy 31:21), and it is said, ""For I know your rebellion"" (Deuteronomy 31:27), for I knew that after my death, you would corrupt yourselves (Deuteronomy 31:29)."
31,21,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Shabbat 20:2","We are taught that R. Simon b. Jochai said: ""God forbid that the Torah be forgotten by Israel, for it is said (Deu. 31, 21.) For it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of their seed. How then can the previous passage, They will roam about to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it; be upheld? It means they shall not find a perfect uncontested Halacha; nor a MishDah beyond refutation any longer in one place."" "
31,21,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Khagigah 1:10","When R. Jochanan came to the following verse, he wept (Deut. 31, 21) And it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles shall come unto you. He said: ""Is there any hope for a slave, for whom his master prepares trouble?"" What is the meaning of evils and troubles? Said Rab: ""Evils that trouble each other; for instance, a man is bitten by a bee and a scorpion. To cure the bee's sting warm is needed, and for a scorpion's bite, cold water is needed; hence the use of either will harm the other wound."" (Deut. 31, 17) And My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be given to be devoured. Said R. Bard'la b. Tebyumi in the name of Rab: ""A man from whom God hides not His face is not included in the above, nor is one who is not of those mentioned in the passage given to be devoured (ib. b) included in the above."" The Rabbis said to Raba: ""It seems to us that you are included neither in the hiding of the face, nor in the devouring."" And he rejoined: ""Do you know how much I must send secretly to King Shabur?"" Nevertheless the Rabbis looked at him with an evil eye, and finally men came from the government and confiscated his property. He then said: ""This is what we are taught that Rabban Simon b. Gamaliel says: 'Wherever the sages looked at with their eyes, either death or poverty followed.'"" (Ib.) And I will hide My face from them. Raba said: ""The Holy One, praised be He! said: 'Although I have hidden my face from them, nevertheless will I talk to them in the dream.'"" R. Joseph said: ""Still His hand is inclined to us, as it is said (Is. 51, 16) With the shadow of My hand have I covered thee."" "
31,21,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 78:1,"""Make Asaph listen to my teaching. As it says in the scripture (Deuteronomy 4:9-10), ""Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children— how on the day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, the Lord said to me, 'Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.'” God made a covenant with Israel not for their sake, but for the sake of the Torah so that it would not be forgotten from their mouths. As it says, ""And He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel"" (Psalm 78:5). The Torah that God gave to Israel is the elixir of life, and it says, ""For it is not an empty thing for you, because it is your life"" (Deuteronomy 32:47). One should not say that only the Psalms are Torah, but also the riddles and parables that are allegories of the Torah. As it says, ""I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old"" (Psalm 78:2). And as God says to Ezekiel, ""Son of man, put forth a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel"" (Ezekiel 17:2). And as Solomon says, ""To understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles"" (Proverbs 1:6). Therefore, Asaph says, ""Make Asaph listen to my teaching. The Psalms are Torah."" They said to Asaph, ""You do not know."" He replied, ""I will recount what we have heard and understood: And He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel."" The Torah that God gave to Israel is a healing remedy, as it says, ""It will be health to your flesh"" (Proverbs 3:8).""..."
31,21,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 32:12:2,"ואין עמו אל נכר AND THERE WAS NO STRANGE GOD WITH HIM — for not one of the gods of the other peoples possessed the power to display its might and to war with them. — Our Rabbis, however, explained it as a promise referring to the future (cf. Sifrei Devarim 315), and so, too, does Onkelos render it. But I say that they (the statements of this chapter) are words of reproof which he said with the view of calling heaven and earth as witnesses against them, and also in order that this song (cf. Deuteronomy 31:21) should be witness, because He knew (Deuteronomy 31:29) that they would in future prove faithless and would bear in mind neither the past (lit., the first) deeds that He performed for them nor those that would come to pass (lit., that would be born), which at a future time He would do for them. For this reason it is necessary to make the text fit in with this and with that (the past and the future). Indeed, the whole section is to be connected with (v. 7) “Remember the days of old (i.e., the past), consider the years of generation after generation” (the future) (cf. Rashi on that verse): Thus has He done for them and thus will He in the future do for them — all this they ought to bear in mind."
31,21,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:21:1","כי ידעתי את יצרו, “for I am familiar with its basic inclination;” even if I did not possess knowledge of future events, I could draw valid conclusions of how they would behave, based on the past performance of this people.

31,21,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 48:9,"An analogy: Two men meet, and they do not separate from each other until one has walked a mil, and the other, a mil, at which time they are found to be at a distance of two mills from each other. Variantly: Lest you say: There are the sons of the elders, there are the sons of the great ones, there are the sons of the prophets (i.e., Let them study the Torah!) It is, therefore, written ""For if keep, you (plural [i.e., all of you]) shall keep all of this mitzvah."" We are hereby taught that all are equal in (the mitzvah of studying) Torah. And thus is it written (Devarim 33:4) ""Torah was commanded to us by Moses, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob"": It is not written ""Cohanim, Levites, and Israelites,"" but ""the congregation of Jacob."" And thus is it written (Ibid. 29:9) ""You are standing this day, all of you, before the L-rd your G-d, your heads of your tribes, your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel."" If not for (all of) these, who stood and fulfilled Torah in Israel, would Torah not have been forgotten in Israel? And if Shafan in his time (viz. II Kings 22) and Ezra in his time and R. Akiva in his time had not stood up (on behalf of Torah), would Torah not have been forgotten in Israel? And it is written (Proverbs 15:3) ""A thing in its time — how good!"" The thing that this one (i.e., each one of those in his time) said is over and against all! It is written (Amos 8:12) ""They will wander to seek the word of the L-rd and they will not find it"": As a tourist, who goes from city to city and from province to province, so is a woman destined to make the rounds of the houses of prayer and the houses of study about a sheretz (a creeping thing) that had touched a loaf to determine whether (this is an instance of) first-degree or second-degree tumah (uncleanliness). R. Shimon b. Yochai says: G-d forbid (to say) that Torah will be forgotten from Israel. Is it not written (Devarim 31:21) ""for it will not be forgotten from the mouth of their seed""? How, then, am I to understand ""They will wander to seek the word of the L-rd and they will not find it""? They will not find a clear halachah in one place, but one man will forbid, and another permit; one man will rule unclean, and another, clean, and they will not find a clear thing."
31,21,Talmud,Shabbat 138b:17,"An opposing view was taught in another baraita. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Heaven forfend that the Torah should be forgotten from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “And this song shall answer to him as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten from his seed” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Rather, how do I explain: “They will roam to find the word of God, but they will not find it”? It means that they will not find"
31,21,Midrash,Vayikra Rabbah 11:7,"Rabbi Tanḥuma and Rabbi Ḥiyya say, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i: This midrash came up from the Diaspora in our possession. Wherever it is stated, “it was in the days,” it is nothing other than trouble.   Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: They are five. “It was in the days of Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war, etc.” (Genesis 14:2). This is analogous to the friend of a king who entered a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. Barbarians came and confronted him. When they came and confronted him, everyone said: ‘Woe unto us, for the king will not attend to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is written: “[All the families of the earth] shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to the entire world. The Chaldeans came and confronted him. [People] said: ‘Woe unto us that the Holy One blessed be He will not attend to His world the way that He once did.’ That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Ḥiyya said: They sought to confront only the eyeball [galgal eino] of the world. (Abraham was as precious to the world as the eyeball is to a person. )  They sought to blind the eye [ayin] that confronted the attribute of justice in the world. (The name Ein Mishpat is interpreted as a reference to eye [ayin] and justice [mishpat]. )  “Which [hi] is Kadesh,” Rabbi Aḥa says: Hu (The word “which” is pronounced hi, but written hey-vav-aleph, such that it can be read hu, which literally means  “he.” is written, [indicating that] it was he who sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He, and descended into the fiery furnace. When the kings came to confront him, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai]; “it was [vayhi] in the days of Amrafel the king of [Shinar].”  “It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1). What trouble was there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west; [they devour Israel with an open mouth]” (Isaiah 9:11). This is analogous to a king who entrusted his son to a steward, but the steward hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will become liable to be executed by the king. Rather, I will withhold his wet nurse from him and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats, there is no flock, and if there is no flock, there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, there is no world. So said Aḥaz: If there are no children, there are no students,17If there are no children at the beginning stages of their studies there will be no students at the intermediate level.  and if there are no students, there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there is no Torah, if there is no Torah, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).   Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was his name called Aḥaz? Because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: You may derive it from this [verse]: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim as this time, in whose regard it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). From that moment “I sought Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me [are to become signs and wonders in Israel]” (Isaiah 8:18).18This is stated by the prophet Isaiah. Despite the attempts of Aḥaz, Torah would not be forgotten from Israel.  But were they his children? Were they not merely his students? Rather, it is derived from here that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.”  “It was during the days of Yehoyakim son of Josiah” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, [and the heavens, and their light is not]” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to letters of a king that entered a province. In each and every province that his letters would reach, the residents of the province would stand on their feet, bare their heads, and read them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. But when they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, when Yehudi read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23). When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). When they saw this, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.”  “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a vineyard and three enemies confronted him. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Every son who is born [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22). Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “And the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:16).19This is a reference to the social elites, who were exiled in the exile of Yehoyakhin, eleven years before the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbi, Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda says: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths, and the Rabbis say: Both together were one thousand. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon says: These are Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak says: These are the benefactors. The Rabbis say: These are the counselors. The wicked Haman began uprooting the vines. That is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel. He sought to purchase every foundation.20A literal translation of the Hebrew is: “He sought to purchase every egg,” meaning to control and extinguish all future potential before it could be developed.  When everyone saw that Aḥashverosh was selling and Haman purchasing, they began screaming: Woe, woe [vai, vai] – “it was [vayhi] during the days of  Aḥashverosh.”  “It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). This is analogous to a province that owed a tribute to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did residents of the province do? They arose and hung him and appropriated it from him. They [then] said: ‘Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters, that we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us.’ So too, when one of the people of Israel would do something improper, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You demean your judges; as you live, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to withstand.’ What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).  Shimon bar Rav Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: Wherever [the term] vayhi is stated, it refers to trouble or joy; if trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if joy, unparalleled joy. Rabbi Yishmael came and suggested a different distinction: Wherever vayhi is stated there is no joy; wherever vehaya is stated, there is no trouble.   They raised an objection: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light” (Genesis 1:3). He said to them: That too, is not joy, as the world was not privileged to utilize that light, as Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: With the light that the Holy One blessed be He created on the first day a person could observe and see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the actions of the generation of Enosh and the actions of the generation of the Flood were corrupt, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “The light is withheld from the wicked” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11).   They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] evening [and it was morning, one day]” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to come to an end. That is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth [will be tattered like a garment]” (Isaiah 51:6).  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8), [and] third, fourth, fifth, the sixth.21The same phrasing is used in the descriptions of the creation of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth days. See Genesis 1:13, 19, 23, 31. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation require completion; wheat requires grinding, mustard requires sweetening, and lupines require sweetening.  They raised an objection: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph and he was a successful man” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, for as a result, that wicked woman confronted him.  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day [Moses summoned Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel]” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, was not joy, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died. They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses concluded [erecting the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, was not joy, as on the day of the Temple’s construction, it was sequestered.22The Tabernacle was not permanent, and was hidden when the Temple was completed.   They raised an objection: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as Ya’ir, who was equivalent [in stature] to the majority of the Sanhedrin, was killed. That is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, approximately thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather approximately, or like, thirty-six; that is Ya’ir ben Menashe, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin.   They raised an objection: “David was [vayhi] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it is written there: “Saul was hostile to David” (I Samuel 18:9).  They raised an objection: “It was [vayhi] when the king had settled in his house, and the Lord had given him respite” (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who will build [Me] a house” (I Chronicles 17:4).  They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours.23We have stated our objections; now you state the proofs to your position.  He said to them, it is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep alive a calf of the herd [and two sheep]” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge [from Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 14:8). “He will be [vehaya] like a tree planted near streams of water” (Psalms 1:3). “The remnant of Jacob will be [vehaya] among the nations, [in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the flocks of sheep]” (Micah 5:7).   They raised an objection to him: “It was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: That, too, is not trouble, as on that day, Israel received retribution for its sins, as Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Naḥman said: Israel received great retribution on the day that the Temple was destroyed.24Israel was punished for its sins through the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. Were it not for that, the entire populace would have been killed as a result of their sins (Etz Yosef).  That is what is written: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion, and He will not continue to exile you” (Lamentations 4:22).) "
31,21,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Fifth Treatise on Devotion 6:2","As the verses say: ""Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life"" (Mishlei 4:23), and ""for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth"" (Bereishis 8:21), ""For I know their imagination.."" (Devarim 31:21), ""for the L-rd searches all hearts, and He understands all the imaginations of the thoughts of every creation; [if you seek Him, He will be found to you, and if you forsake Him, He will abandon you forever]"" (Divrei Hayamim 28:9), ""Rather,[this] thing is very close to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it"" (Devarim 30:14), ""And now, O Israel, what does the L-rd, your G-d, demand of you? Only to fear (revere) the L-rd, your G-d"" (Devarim 10:12), and fear (reverence) is in the heart, reflections, and thoughts. Therefore, my brother, strive that all of your actions be devoted only to the blessed Creator, so that your exertion will not be for nothing, and your efforts not for falsehood, as written ""Why should you weigh out money for that which is not bread and your toil without satiety?"" (Yeshaya 55:2)."
31,21,Midrash,"Ruth Rabbah, Petichta 7","Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile: (From Babylonia. Presumably, this is a way of stating that it is an ancient tradition.)  Any place that “It was [vayhi]” is stated, [it alludes to] trouble. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: Any place that “It was [vayhi]” is stated, it can serve [to allude to] either trouble or joy. If it is trouble, there is none like it. If it is joy, there is none like it. Rabbi Shmuel said: There are five [instances of] “during the days of [bimei].” “It was [vayhi] during the days of [bimei] Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1) – what was the trouble there? They waged a war. [It is analogous] to the friend of a king who was located in a certain province. Because of him, the king took care of the province. One time, barbarians came and beset him [the king’s friend]. They say: Woe for us, the king will no longer care for the province as he had done. Likewise, the entire world was created only due to the merit of Abraham our patriarch; that is what is written: “They turned back and came to Ein Mishpat, (Ein Mishpat literally means ‘eye of justice’.)  which is [hi] Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Aḥa said: They came to beset the eyeball of the world. (Abraham.)  The eye that overcame the attribute of justice in the world you seek to blind? (The midrash is rhetorically addressing the kings that attacked Abraham.)  “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Hu Kadesh. (The word hi, meaning ‘which is,’ is spelled with a vav as the middle letter, which could be read as the masculine hu. The midrash is reading hi Kadesh as hu kidesh, he sanctified.)  He [Abraham] sanctified [kidesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace. (See Tanḥuma, Lekh Lekha 6.)  When everyone saw that all the kings came to beset him, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; that is, “It was [vayhi] during the reign of Amrafel.” “It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11) – [it is analogous] to the son of a king who had a tutor who sought to kill him. He [the tutor] said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So did Aḥaz say: If there are no kids, there are no rams, and if there are no rams there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd. So Aḥaz thought to say: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, cannot rest His Divine Presence in the world. Therefore, I will seize all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16). Rabbi Ḥanina said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Avin: Isaiah said: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as difficult for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18) – in this world. But from that moment, “I hoped for Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Was it [this verse] fulfilled for him [Isaiah]? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me” (Isaiah 8:18) – were they his [Isaiah’s] children? Were they not his students? It teaches that they were as dear to him as his sons. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [vai]: that is, “It was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.” “It was during the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, and the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23) – [it is analogous] to a king who sent a proclamation to a province. What did the residents of the province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. They said: Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these matters. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), (This is the fifth verse of the first chapter of Lamentations.)  immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the end of the scroll, upon the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; that is, “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.” “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [It was] “to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews” (Esther 3:13). [It is analogous] to a king who entered a vineyard and three enemies beset him: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third sought to uproot all the vines. Likewise, the wicked Pharaoh begin picking the unripe grapes; that is what is written: “[Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:] Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22). The wicked Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “[He exiled Yehoyakhin.…] and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:15–16). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of them were one thousand. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Haman the wicked sought to uproot the entire egg; (Egg, in the sense of the very origins of Israel.)  [as] they say buy [the hen] with the egg (A aphorism meaning that he sought to complete the task, leaving no future.)  – “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [vai]; “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥashverosh.” “It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1) – [it is analogous] to a province that owed a tax to the king. What did the king do? He sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They took him, struck him, and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: What he sought to do to us we did to him. Likewise, during the days when the judges judged, an Israelite person would worship idols, and a judge would seek to bring him to trial, and he would come and flog the judge. He would say: What he sought to do to me, I did to him. Woe unto a generation whose judges are judged; (The midrash is reading the verse to mean that it was in the days that the judges were judged, i.e. punished.)  that is, “It was during the days when the judges judged.” Shimon bar Rabbi Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that it [“it was,” vayhi] is stated, [it alludes to] trouble or to joy; if trouble, there is no trouble like it, if joy, there is no joy like it in the world. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a [different] distinction: Everywhere that it says, “it was [vayhi],” [it alludes to] trouble, everywhere that it says “it will be [vehaya],” joy. But it is written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light.” He said to them: Even that is not light of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When He perceived that the wicked were destined to appear, like the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion, (After the Tower of Babel.)  and like the people of Sodom, He took it [the light] away. That is what is written: “From the wicked their light is withheld” (Job 38:15). He sequestered it for the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11). They objected to him: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as the heavens are destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke” (Isaiah 51:6). They objected to him: Is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day.… third.… fourth.… fifth.… sixth” (Genesis 1:8–31). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, e.g., it is necessary to sweeten mustard, lupines must be sweetened, and wheat requires grinding. But it is written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it is written: “For they placed me in the pit” (Genesis 40:15). But it is written: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed [assembling the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was sequestered when the Temple was built, as it is stated: “Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 40:35). (The verse does not seem to be related to the point. Perhaps it is brought to communicate that even on the day that the construction of the Tabernacle was completed, the celebration was tempered by the fact that Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] when Joshua was [at Jericho]” (Joshua 5:13). He said to them: That too is not joy, as Joshua rent his garments, as it is stated: “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6). (After the setback at Ai.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day” (Leviticus 9:1). (The day of the dedication of the Temple.)  He said to them: That too is not joy, as on that day Nadav and Avihu died. (See Leviticus 10:1–2.)  But it is written: “It was [vayhi] when the king (David.)  dwelled in his house” (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: That too was not joy, as it was then that Natan the prophet came and said to him: “However, you will not build the House” (I Kings 8:19). They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. (Prove that every place it says vehaya it is an expression of joy.)  He said to them: It is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge [from Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be on that day that the Lord will set His hand again the second time, [to recover the remnant of His people]” (Isaiah 11:11). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep [a calf of the herd and two sheep] alive” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, [and they will come…and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem]” (Isaiah 27:13). “It will be that one who is left in Zion and he that remains in Jerusalem [will be called holy]” (Isaiah 4:3). They objected to him: It is written: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Israel made complete penance for their iniquities, on the day that the Temple was destroyed. Conclusion of the prologue to Rut Rabba"
31,21,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 26:44:2","A Midrashic approach based on Sifra quoted presently: the word זאת refers to the Torah in which it is written וזאת התורה, “this” is the Torah (Deut. 4,44). The verse is a hint that the Torah will not depart from the Jewish people when they are in exile. This promise is parallel to a similar promise by Moses in Deut. 31,21 כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו, “she will not be forgotten from the mouth of its offspring.” Our sages in Sifra Bechukotai 8,10 used this verse to say that the only thing which the Jewish people will retain of all their former glory and which will ensure that they are not totally despised is the Torah. If this had been taken from them also they would be entitled to claim that G’d had totally despised them and been revolted by them."
31,21,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 26:1:8","ושמת בטנא, “and you shall place it in a basket.” According to the plain meaning of the text the bikkurim were a distinctive present for the priest, an honor for the Almighty, and its presentation was of great practical use for the people of Israel. It was a present of great distinction for the priest seeing that the farmer personally carried the gift all the way to Jerusalem from whatever part of the country he lived in. It was an honor for the Almighty seeing that the farmer came all the way to offer prayers of thanksgiving to the Lord in connection with the bikkurim. The farmer acknowledged that all blessing originates with the Lord. The bikkurim procedure was of practical use to the Jewish people seeing that fulfillment of this commandment resulted in the bounty of the fields and orchards being greatly increased as G’d’s response to fulfillment of the commandment. The word טנא means the same as סל, “basket.” It serves as a receptacle for the fruit. This verse is the source for the ruling that the bikkurim must be presented in a receptacle (Maimonides Hilchot Bikkurim 3,7). This is one of seven different parts of the procedure of bringing the bikkurim. They are: 1) bringing them to the designated site, 2) presentation in a suitable receptacle; 3) reciting the appropriate verses from the Torah; 4) the actual presentation to the priest; 5) an accompanying song, 6) the “heaving” of the fruit. 7) The remaining of the owner inside Jerusalem on the night following presentation. Let us describe the stages in detail: Bringing the fruit to a designated place, i.e. Jerusalem, is based on the line: “you will proceed to the place designated by the Lord to make a residence there for His name” (26,2). The need to deposit the bikkurim in a receptacle is based on the words ושמת בטנא, the same verse. The best way to comply with this instruction is to present each species of bikkurim in its own receptacle. However, if the various species have all been presented in the same receptacle this is acceptable. They must not, however, be mixed inside that receptacle but inferior species must be placed below superior species, such as the wheat which must be on top of the barley. Dates would have to be placed on top of both species of grain, etc. The figs are to be on top of all the other species. There is not to be a foreign substance intervening between the various layers of the fruit if they are all presented in the same receptacle (basket). It is best to surround the figs with grapes (Maimonides ibid.).  The donor brings pigeons and turtle doves at the same time as a sacrificial offering seeing the Torah writes: “you shall rejoice with all the goodness” (and there is no true enjoyment unless accompanied by the eating of some kind of meat (Pessachim 109). These birds were suspended on the sides of the basket in order to decorate the bikkurim. The birds attached to the baskets were offered as burnt-offering, whereas the ones carried by the donors in their hands served as peace-offerings, and they were given to the priests of the respective roster. The priests divide them among themselves as they do with other offerings (Maimonides Hilchot Bikkurim 3,1). The recital of the verses pertaining to this commandment consisted of the reading of verses 5-to the middle of verse 10. This recital is to be in a loud voice and in Hebrew (the text of the verses of the Torah in its original). This requirement is based on the words of Deut. 31,21 וענתה השירה הזאת, “this song shall speak up as...” Just as that song has to be recited in the original Hebrew, so the acknowledgment of G’d’s bounty when bringing the bikkurim has to be in the original Hebrew. Both the passages employ the word וענית when introducing the obligation. We find that expression also in connection with the recital of the confession of the elders that their hands are free from guilt of the unidentified victim of murder described at the end of Parshat Shoftim (Deut. 21,7). This declaration also has to be made in Hebrew(Sotah 44).  קרבן, the presentation of the offering; every person offering bikkurim must also offer a peace-offering. Song; the need to accompany the offering by a “song” is based on the verse: “you shall rejoice with all the goodness,” and joy is traditionally expressed as a form of song. Our sages base this on Psalms 33,3: הטיבו נגן בתרועה, “play sweetly with shouts of joy.” This is what the Levites did, beginning when the donors brought the bikkurim to the lobby of the Temple (עזרה). The “heaving,” waving of the basket with its contents. This is derived from the word והנחתו, “you are to deposit it,” implying that prior to being deposited it was “lifted, waved,” etc. The procedure consisted of the priest placing his hand under the hand of the owner and waving it to and fro (Sukkah 16). This is the meaning of the words (verse 4) “and the priest shall take (accept) the basket from your hand and place it in front of the altar of the Lord your G’d,” i.e. to swing it in front of the altar. לינה, the requirement for the donor to spend the following night in Jerusalem. This rule is derived from Deut 16,7: “and you will turn in the morning (after the Passover) and return to your tents.” It is forbidden to depart from Jerusalem except on the morning after (or later). (Maimonides Hilchot Bikkurim 3,14)  The bikkurim are forbidden to non-priests as the Torah has compared them to תרומה, describing them as תרומת ידך, “the gift of your hand,” in Deut. 12,17. Our sages in Makkot 17 base this inference on the word מידך which follows the word הטנא in verse 4 of our chapter. Just as a non-priest must not eat תרומה, so he is also forbidden to eat bikkurim. A priest who is in pre-mourning for close relatives (אונן) is also forbidden to eat the bikkurim while in that state. Clearly, he is not in a joyous frame of mind, a prerequisite for eating bikkurim as we have explained (Maimonides Hilchot Bikkurim 3,6)."
31,21,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:21:1","והיה כי תמצאן אתו רעות רבות וצרות וענתה השירה הזאת לפניו לעד; “it will be when many evils and distresses come upon it, then this song shall speak up before it as a witness.” This is a reference to the song at the beginning of Parshat Haazinu. There the Torah speaks in detail about the ones who have been cast out."
31,21,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:21:2-4","כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו כי ידעתי את יצרו אשר הוא עושה היום, “for it will not be forgotten from the mouth of its offspring; for I know its inclination, what it does today.” Moses says that he can draw conclusions from Israel’s behavior in his own time when the people suffer from an inclination to practice idolatry. It is likely therefore that they will put their inclination into practice in the future. This is why, when the penalties described here, i.e. the sufferings, will occur, they will find that they have all been foretold in the Torah. The reason they will find this out is that the Torah will not be forgotten among their offspring (despite their committing all these sins). The witnesses in the song in the Torah in which heaven and earth are called on will endure and give their testimony.  The reason Moses was allowed to say such words as “for I know its inclination,” [in a negative connotation, and G’d did not punish him for slandering the people as He had done in Exodus when he had said they would not believe him (Exodus 4,1), Ed.] is that G’d Himself had described the people in these terms in Psalms 103,14 where the psalmist says “for He knows our inclinations.” Midrash Tehillim on this verse states; “woe to the dough of which the baker himself says that it is defective.” It seems to me that the wording of the Torah does suggest that there would come a time when the Torah would indeed be forgotten by the people. The time in question is when, in the future, the evil urge will be annulled, as distinct from the messianic era during which, as we pointed out previously, (Shabbat 138) “business will be as usual,” all the commandments of the Torah remaining applicable. As long as this present universe continues, Torah will continue as the guideline for the Jewish people to live by. The period when Torah will be “forgotten” will be during the period of the resurrection. In other words, as long as the people have the same inclination as now, i.e. they are burdened with the evil urge, Torah will not be forgotten by them. Once they are free from the evil urge there is no need to remember Torah. At that time the only holiday which will still be celebrated will be that of Purim, (seeing that it came about as a reward for the Israelites who had done תשובה). The foregoing is based on a Midrash Mishlei 9, where the sages comment on the verse in Proverbs 9,2: טבחה טבחה, מסכה יינה, אף ערכה שלחנה, “she has slaughtered the meat, mixed her wine, she has also set her table.” The sages understand these words as describing the time when Queen Esther prepared the meal for the King and Haman. The words: “she also prepared her table,” which appear superfluous, mean that she prepared for the life in the hereafter as well as for that on earth when she took those fateful steps. The emphasis on this meal, i.e. a festive meal, is an allusion to the time in the future when all the festivals and their festive meals will be abolished, although the festive meal on Purim will not be abolished. This is the meaning of the words at the end of Megillat Esther 9,28: “and these days of Purim will not disappear and their memory (what occasioned them) will not be forgotten by the Jews or their offspring.”"
31,21,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:21:1","That I have warned them, in it, etc. And you have no excuse to say that if we had known of all these bad punishments we would not have transgressed Hashem’s commandments. For then they will read this song which has written in it explicitly the warning that He warned them of all these bad things [if they transgress Hashem’s commandments]. "
31,21,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:21:2","This is a guarantee to Yisroel, etc. He means to say that our eyes see that the hearts are diminishing [from Torah knowledge], so why is it written, For it shall never be forgotten, etc.?

31,21,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 22:5:5,"When the Torah speaks of ומצאה קוצים, this is a reference to the wicked who are considered nothing but painful thorns. The expression ומצאה may be understood in a sense similar to Deut. 31,21 that ""trouble befell them."" The justification for using the word מצאה is that the wicked have no one who is responsible for them, either benevolently or otherwise. Wickedness means rejection of authority. G'd is the only true authority, and He has abandoned them as a result of their deliberate wickedness. Anything that happens in their lives subsequently is in the nature of a מציאה, a find, something one comes upon accidentally. Anyone who encounters such a person may do to him what he wants without divine interference. The verse also informs us that once fire has been given permission to act destructively, i.e. as the attribute of Justice, it will not only burn the thorns but it will also consume the stack of corn (the good, the useful). The choice of the word גדיש is an allusion to youngsters studying Torah, children who have not yet attained the height of adults, i.e. קמה. They are swept away together with the guilty as part of the troubles sweeping society. According to Shir Hashirim Rabbah on Song of Songs 1,4, when G'd was about to give the Jewish people the Torah He demanded guarantors that the people would continue to observe it. After having turned down the patriarchs as suitable guarantors, the Midrash relates that G'd accepted the people's children as their guarantors. This is the meaning of Psalms 8,3: ""from the mouths of infants and sucklings You have established strength, etc."" As a result of this arrangement the attribute of Justice is entitled to include such children in retribution when these forces are at work."
31,21,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 12:2:6,"The verse also contains an allusion to the כנסת ישראל, the Jewish people as a conceptual entity. We find that this term is applied to women in such verses as Isaiah 54,5: כי בעליך עושיך, ""for He who has made you will espouse you;"" the prophet also continues: ואשת נעורים, ""and the wife of your youth;"" the prophet Hoseah describes the relationship of G'd and כנסת ישראל in Hoseah 2,21: וארשתיך לי לעולם, (G'd speaking to His bride) ""I will betroth Myself to you forever, etc."" Isaiah 50,1: ""where is the bill of divorce I have given you?"" There are more such verses to be found scattered throughout the Books of the Prophets. וילדה זכר, ""and she gives birth to a male child, etc."" when viewed from a moral-ethical vantage-point, the Torah reveals that when the מזריע the initiative for the husband-wife relationship with G'd originates with the Jewish people, the כנסת ישראל, then the product of such an initiative will be a male child, זכר, the entire nation will attain the highest spiritual level. The word זכר, male, is hyperbole for the highest moral-ethical achievenment. In Sanhedrin 98 and Shemot Rabbah 15 the superiority of the ultimate redemption to the redemption at the time of the Exodus from Egypt is described. The ultimate redemption is perceived there as the corollary of Israel distinguishing itself by the performance of good deeds, etc. The prophet described the Exodus in terms of Israel being ""naked and nude"" (Ezekiel 16,7). Clothing is perceived as a layer of מצות and good deeds covering our bodies. The inadequacy of the Jewish people at the time of the Exodus is underlined in Deut. 4,34 where G'd describes the Exodus as wrenching one people from the midst of the same people, something that made it legally difficult for G'd to justify taking the Israelites out of Egypt when He did. That redemption has been described only in female terms and that is why it did not endure in the end and the Temple was destroyed. Not so the redemption of the future which will occur as a direct result of Israel's merits. First and foremost among those merits is Israel's preoccupation with Torah as described in Deut. 31,21 something that will never be forgotten even during a protracted period of exile. The Torah continues: וטמאה, the mother contracts ritual impurity as a result of giving birth. Here the Torah alludes to the way G'd initiates a process which culminates in the rehabilitation of Israel so that it will attain a spiritual level that qualifies for the description זכר. The ""days"" mentioned here are to be understood as seven years similar to Genesis 24,55 where Laban and his mother wanted Rebeccah to delay her departure by ימים, i.e. a year. The years which are viewed as the חבלי משיח, the birth-pangs of the Messiah, last for seven years during which Israel will be refined spiritually in preparation of his arrival. He will make his appearance during the eighth year. On the eighth day, at the beginning of the eighth day (year), the baby is to have its foreskin removed, i.e. the concept of a foreskin which acts as a barrier between man and G'd will be removed from the universe. We read in Zachariah 13,2 that G'd will destroy the spirit of impurity from the earth. This will occur during the eighth year. It is well known that conceptually the foreskin is identical with the forces of the קליפה, the spiritually negative emanations. When the Torah wrote the word וטמאה, describing the state of the mother, this is a simile for the afflictions experienced during the birth-pangs of the Messiah."
31,21,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Terumah, Torah Ohr 63","The best way to explain the Midrash is by reference to the three different kinds of crowns. When G–d describes Israel as a flock and Himself as its shepherd, this is an allusion to the crown of Torah. We have a verse in Ezekiel 34,31: ""Now you My flock, flock of My pasture—you are Adam. I am your G–d, says the Lord G–d."" The meaning of this verse is that though, at this time, Torah knowledge amongst the Jewish people is only at the level of sheep, there will come a time when the Jewish people will once more be comparable to Adam, a time at which the whole earth will be full of the knowledge of G–d. David Kimchi explains the verse by saying that even when we are in exile the Torah will not be forgotten, since we have an assurance כי לא נשכח מזרעו, ""it will not be forgotten by his descendants"" (Deut. 31,21). We are only called צאן. Our sages have used similar terminology for Jews who have studied little Torah whom they describe them as גדיים, rather than as תישים, young goats instead of mature billy-goats (Berachot 63). Solomon, referring to such immature Jewish people, says in Song of Songs 1,8: צאי לך בעקבי הצאן, ""Go out and follow the tracks of the sheep """
31,21,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Ki Tisa, Torah Ohr 47","We will deal with the significance of the שור in connection with פרשת פרה, which is usually read on the Sabbath we read פרשת כי תשא. Due to our being in exile on account of our many sins, our preoccupation with Torah is unfortunately greatly reduced; this situation will not be drastically changed until the time of the final redemption when the whole world will become filled with the knowledge of G–d (Isaiah 11,9). Our sages state that though generally speaking the Torah is referred to as masculine, when the Torah is spoken of in connection with exile it is referred to as feminine such as in Deut. 31,21 כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו, “For she will not be forgotten by its descendants."" When Torah is thus ""weakened,"" it assumes the image of a feminine שור, i.e. a cow. This is the mystical dimension of the פרה אדומה, the red heifer and of the legislation concerning its treatment. We view the red heifer as the instrument that is to expiate for the fact that the Torah has been downgraded from the image of the male (ox), to the female (cow). The ash of the red heifer purifies a person who has been ritually contaminated by contact with a dead body or exposure to the enclosed airspace harbouring a dead body. "
31,21,Quoting Commentary,"Malbim on Job, Introduction 74","The last debater [Elihu] is the one who reveals the truth about Job's suffering—the matter related at the opening of the story concerning the sons of God and Satan—namely, that it was a trial. Moreover, that Job had indeed worshipped God out of love and had passed the test of prosperity, serving the Lord without any expectation of riches. Towards the end of his speech, at the close of his argument, Elihu, the last of the protagonists, reveals to Job the true reason for his suffering: that it had been a trial. How, as was related in the Prologue, Satan had presented himself before God; that Job had indeed served God out of love, worshipping Him without any ulterior motive; that he had passed the trial of prosperity and that God had now wanted to try him with poverty, in order to see whether his step would veer from the path (Job 31:7) when so many disasters and calamities befell him. (Deuteronomy 31:21. 'The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Job: 'Which do you want: poverty or suffering?' Job replied: 'I would rather any affliction in the world but not poverty. When I go to the market and I haven't even a prutah [a small coin] with which to buy anything, what will I eat?' When he began to suffer and to cry out, Elihu said to him: 'Why are you crying out? Didn't you accept any suffering so long as it wasn't poverty?'' (Exodus Rabbah 31:12))  For he would then have been tested in both ways, and would have been like the sons of God who transcend the flesh. But on the basis of the evidence he had in fact failed this trial, for he had spoken wickedly against the Lord. (Isaiah 32:6. 'Had he controlled his anger and not complained against Providential justice...then just as we now say in our prayers 'God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob' we would also say 'God of Job'' (Pesikta Rabbati 49, 20). However, Job is a man, and no man is an angel: 'There is no man in the world so righteous that he always does good and never does bad.' (Ecclesiastes 7:20)) "
31,21,Chasidut,"Likutei Moharan, Go See 3","Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai gave assurances that through him the Torah would not be forgotten from the Jewish people. As our Sages teach (Shabbat 138b): When our rabbis entered the yeshivah in Yavneh, they said, “The Torah will one day be forgotten by the Jews.” But Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said that it would not be forgotten, as is written (Deuteronomy 31:21), “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring.” And, as is explained in the Zohar (III, 124b): Because of this work, the Book of the Zohar, [the Jews] will be redeemed from exile. So now come, see and understand the hidden wonders of our holy Torah. This is why Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai based himself on this verse: “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring.” For, in truth, this mystery is hinted at and concealed in this very verse. Through the offspring of Yochai, this being Rashby, the Torah will not be forgotten by the Jews. This is because the final letters of the words in this verse “kI loA tishakhaCh mipiY zar’O” are the same letters as YOChAI. This is what the verse hints to and reveals: “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring”—specifically “from the mouth of his offspring.” That is, “from the mouth of the offspring” of the one who is himself alluded to and hidden in this verse, this being the sage Yochai. Because of the offspring of Yochai, who is hinted at in the final letters of the words in this verse—this being Rashby—the Torah will not be forgotten; for with this Zohar they will be redeemed from exile, as above. And know! the mystery of Rabbi Shimon himself is alluded to in another verse. Know that the holy sage Rabbi Shimon corresponds to (Daniel 4:10): “Ir V’kaddish Min Shemaya Nachit (An angel, a holy one, descended from heaven)”—the first letters of which are ShIMON….

31,21,Chasidut,"Likutei Halakhot, Orach Chaim, Laws of Morning Conduct 1:8:1","GOOD POINTS, OFFERINGS AND MELODIES Reb Noson next cites Chazal’s account of the communal korban tamid, daily-offering, brought in the Beit HaMikdash. Representatives of all three branches of the Jewish people—the Kohanim, Leviim and Yisraelim—participated. Reb Noson will explain how this mirrors beirur of the good points, creating melodies, and elevating the good points as the dibbur of prayer. Now, this refining of the good points from the animalistic desires finds expression in Chazal’s statement: “[There were] Kohanim with their sacrificial service, presenting the offering; Leviim on their platform, chanting and playing music; and the appointed group of Yisraelim, the maamad delegation, standing at their station and reciting passages of Torah.” (Megillah 3a; Taanit 26a ff. Chazal teach that legislation instituted in the days of David HaMelekh divided the Kohanim into mishmarot (lit. “watches”), 24 family groupings tasked with performing the service in the Beit HaMikdash in rotating shifts, a week at a time. Twenty-four mishmarot of Leviim were likewise appointed, tasked with providing musical accompaniment in rotating shifts from a nearby platform while the Kohanim presented the korbanot. The Yisraelim too were divided into 24 groups, known as maamadot (lit. “standing groups”). A delegation of each group of Yisraelim, known as anshei maamad, men of standing, would ascend to Yerushalayim as emissaries of all the people. From their station near the korbanot during the service, the anshei maamad would pray that HaShem receive the offering of their fellow Jews with favor. Meanwhile, the remainder of each maamad of Yisraelim would gather in their towns to pray, fast, and recite from the Torah’s account of Creation, showing that the world exists in the merit of the korbanot. Over time, this collection of special prayers and Torah readings came to be known as Maamadot.) "
31,21,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 10:2:6,"(Gen. rabba 42(4), Esther rabba Introduction, Lev. rabba 11, Ruth rabba1(7).)  But what did Aḥaz do? He built a throne in the Temple Court. That is what is written: “The throne-hall which they built in the Temple, (This exists no such verse. Probably, as indicated by Qorban ha ˋEdah, the reference is to 2K. 16:18: The Sabbath shelter which they had built in the temple …”) ” etc. Rebbi Onias in the name of Rebbi Eleazar. Why is he called “the grabber (אחז “to grab”.) ”? For he grabbed synagogues and houses of study (To close them down.) . To what may Aḥaz be compared? To a king who had a son whom he entrusted to his pedagogue (Greek παιδαγωγός, the slave accompanying the child.) . The latter wanted to kill him. He said, if I kill him, I will be put to death. But I shall draw his wet-nurse away from him and he will die of himself. So Aḥaz said, if there are no kid goats there are no he-goats. If there are no he-goats there are no goats. If there are no goats there is no shepherd (God.) . If there is no shepherd there is no world; if it were thinkable that there be no world. So Aḥaz was thinking, if there are no children (Going to school.)  there are no adults. If there are no adults, there are no Sages. If there are no Sages, there are no prophets. If there are no prophets, there is no Holy Spirit. If there is no Holy Spirit, there are no synagogues and no houses of study. If it were thinkable, the Holy One, praise to Him, will not let His Presence rest over Israel. Rebbi Jacob bar Abbai in the name of Rebbi Aḥa brings it from the following (That Ahaz had eliminated all religious instruction, Is. 8:17.)  I shall wait for the Eternal, Who hid His Face from the House of Jacob, and put my hope in Him. There was no worse moment in the world than when the Holy One, praise to Him, said to Moses (Deut. 31:18.) : I shall certainly hide My Face at that time. From that moment on, I put my hope in Him, Who said at Sinai, (Deut. 31:21. This was not said at Sinai but in the steppes of Moab; it is a promise that the study of Torah will never cease.)  for it shall not be forgotten by his descendants. What would its use be (Is. 8:18. A different interpretation in the Babli 19b.) ? Behold, I and the children which the Eternal has given me. Were they his children? Were they not his students? But this teaches he loved them as if they were his sons and called them “my sons”."
31,21,Midrash,"Esther Rabbah, Petichta 11","Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Berekhya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great interpreted in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile. Everyplace that vayhi is stated, it means nothing but trouble. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman interpreted in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This midrash came into our possession. Everyplace that vayhi bimei is stated, it means nothing but trouble.  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They are five: “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Amrafel king of Shinar, Ariokh, king of Elasar, Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goyim” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war with Bera, king of Sodom…” (Genesis 14:2). [This is analogous] to the beloved of a king who resided in a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. When barbarians came and afflicted him [the beloved of the king], they [the other residents of the province] said: ‘Woe unto us that the king is not attending to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, “all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:4). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to His entire world. That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). They sought to afflict only the eye of the world [Abraham]. They sought to blind the eye that acts upon the attribute of justice in the world.  ( This probably means that Abraham is responsible for the suppression of the attribute of justice, the result of which is that God rules the world through the attribute of mercy.)  “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Hu [i.e. he rather than she] is written. He [Abraham] sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he went into the fiery furnace. When everyone saw that all the kings came to afflict him, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the reign of Amrafel.” “It was during the days [vayhi bimei] when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land and a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to stay in the field of Moab, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land.” [This is comparable] to a province that owed a tax to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They suspended him [on a pole] and struck him and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters; we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us. So too, when one of the people of Israel would perform inappropriate actions, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: You humiliate your judges; by your lives, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to endure. What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Aḥaz son of Yotam, son of Uziyahu, king of Judah; Retzin, king of Aram and Pekaḥ, son of Remalyahu, king of Israel, went to war against Jerusalem, but he was unable to make war against it” (Isaiah 7:1). What was the trouble there? It was as it is written: “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). [This is comparable] to a king who handed his son over to a tutor, and his tutor hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, the world cannot exist. So Aḥaz thought and said: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars there are no elders, if there are no elders there is no Torah, if there is no Torah there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One, blessed be He, will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls, so that no one would engage in Torah study. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).  Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa derived it from this verse, as it is written: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day because of all the evil that they did…” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But from that moment I hoped for Him, (A reference to the verse quoted above “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17).)  as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did you [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I [Isaiah] and the children whom the Lord gave me are to become signs and wonders in Israel” (Isaiah 8:18). Were they his children? Surely, they were nothing but his students! Rather, from here [we learn] that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [vai]: “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥaz.” “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Yehoyakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder; the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23). [This is comparable] to a king who sent letters from province to province and in each and every province that his letters reached, they would embrace and kiss them, standing on their feet, baring their heads and reading them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. When they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the days of Yehoyakim.” “It was during the days of [vayhi bimei] Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). [This is comparable] to a king who entered a vineyard and encountered three enemies: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. So too, wicked Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22).  Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “He exiled Yehoyakhin…and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:14). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; the Rabbis said: One thousand artisans and smiths. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables.  Haman the wicked, may he be crushed and wiped out, began uprooting the vines; that is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel, he wanted to devastate the whole house [of Israel]. Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [vai];’ “it was [vayhi] during the days of Aḥashverosh.” Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yonatan said: Everywhere that vayhi is stated it refers to trouble or to joy; if it is to trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is to joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabban Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a different distinction: Everywhere that it says vayhi (it was), it refers to trouble, everywhere that it says vehaya (it will be), joy.  They objected: Is it not written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [vayhi] light”? He said to them: Even that is not joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When the Holy One, blessed be He, perceived that the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (after the Tower of Babel) were destined to sin before Him, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “From the wicked was withheld their light” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11).  They objected: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth will be tattered like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6). They objected: It is written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day,” “…a third day,” through the sixth day. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, as they were not completely made, e.g. wheat requires grinding, and mustard and lupines require sweetening. They objected: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as that resulted in that bear (Potifar’s wife.)  confronting him.  They objected: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day, Moses summoned Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, is not good, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died and all of Israel lamented them, as it is stated: “Your brethren, the entire house of Israel, will lament the burning” (Leviticus 10:6). They objected: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was put away when the eternal Temple was built. They objected: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin, was killed; that is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, about thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather “like thirty-six;” ( The verse says: “The men of the Ai killed about thirty-six [ki-shloshim ve-shisha] men…” The prepositional ‘ki-’ can designate approximation, “about thirty-six” or comparison, “like thirty-six.”)  that is Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin [of 70 or 71 members]. What is written there? “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6). They objected: “David was [vayhi] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it resulted in what is written: Saul felt enmity to David” (I Samuel 18:9). They objected: “It was [vayhi] when David dwelled in his house” (I Chronicles 17:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who builds Me the House” (I Chronicles 17:4). They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. He said to them, it is written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar and the hills will flow with milk” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man shall keep a calf of the herd and two sheep alive, and from the abundance of milk produced, he will eat butter, for everyone who remains in the midst of the land will eat butter and honey” (Isaiah 7:21-22). “The remnant of Jacob will be [vehaya] among the nations, in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passes, tramples and mauls, and there is no deliverer” (Micah 5:7). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and the lost in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt will come and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 27:13). “He will be [vehaya] like a tree planted near streams of water which yields fruit in season; its leaves shall not wither, and whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3).  They objected to him: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Menaḥem (The Messiah.)  was born and Israel made penance for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel made great penance at the moment that the Temple was destroyed. That is what is written: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion” (Lamentations 4:22)."
31,21,Tanakh,Genesis 8:21,"יהוה smelled the pleasing odor, and יהוה resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done. "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,21,Halakhah,"Ohr Zarua, Volume I, Laws of Charity 15:3","And I, the author, say that there is no distinction between the forgotten sheaf, the corner and the poor tithe on the one hand, and other charity on the other. As behold there is a story (Jerusalem Talmud Peah 8:7) about a student of Rebbi who had 199 dinar, and Rebbi wanted to bequeath him a large gift. However one of the rabbis completed it to be two hundred (which would disqualify him from receiving charity). Rebbi heard [about this] - he said, ""This one was struck by the plague of the pious."" He [then] said to [another] one of the rabbis, ""Go and remove it from him,"" and he removed it. So Rebbi gave him that present. Behold, you learn from this that someone who has two hundred zuz may not take from the charity fund. But everything is according to his needs and the needs of his household, as Rabbenu Ephraim, may his memory be blessed, explained. And that is how I explain that which my teachers ask about that [passage in the chapter entitled] Haba al Yevimto (Yevamot 63a): The Rabbis taught, ""One who lends a sela to a poor person at his time of need, about him the verse states (Isaiah 58:9), 'Then shall you call, and the Lord will answer.'"" Yet in the first chapter of Chagigah (5a), we say, then ""many evils and troubles are come upon them"" (Deuteronomy 31:21)  - ""Shmuel said, 'This is [referring to] one who provides money to a poor person at his time of need.'"" And it appears in my eyes - me, the author - that that [passage] in Chagigah is when he had 199 dinar and they wanted to give him a thousand dinar, but [this one] heard and completed the two hundred in order to make him lose the thousand that they wanted to give him. There, certainly, ""many evils and troubles are come upon them"" - since he caused this poor man to lose a thousand dinar. But someone who gives a loan to a poor person at his time of need - certainly that one, he shall 'call, and the Lord will answer him.' As he intended [it] for his good. And even if he had 199 dinar and this one lent him a dinar and completed the two hundred with this dinar - nevertheless, it is still called, 'he shall call, and the Lord will answer.' Since this dinar is not his and he has to repay it, he still does not have two hundred of his own; so it is permissible for him to take from the charity fund. And you should know that in the first chapter of Chagigah, it [specifically] mentioned, ""one who provides money to a poor person at the time of his need,"" such that he provides him with that money that it should be his, so that he [then] have two hundred zuz and it would be forbidden for him to take from the charity fund. But here, it is ""one who lends a sela to a poor person"" - as he intends to benefit him with a loan. So he merits, 'he shall call, and the Lord will answer him.' "
31,21,Chasidut,"Likutei Tefilot, Volume II 47:1","Through Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the Jewish People Will Not Forget the Torah / In the Merit of Rabbi Shimon’s Zohar, the Jewish People Will Emerge from Exile Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai promised the Jewish people that through him, the Torah would not be forgotten. When the sages entered the yeshivah in Yavneh, they said, “The Torah will one day be forgotten by the Jews,” but Rabbi Shimon said it would not be, quoting the verse, “For it will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring (כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו, ki loa tisha’khach mipiy zaro)” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Moreover, it states in the Zohar, “With this Zohar, they [the Jews] will be redeemed from exile” (Zohar III, 124b). The final letters of the words in the verse from Deuteronomy, kI loA tisha’khaCh mipiY zarO, spell YOChAI. Thus, the verse is hinting that the Torah will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring — namely, the offspring of Yochai: the sage Rabbi Shimon. Because of Rabbi Shimon’s Zohar, the Jews will be redeemed from exile. The mystery of Rabbi Shimon himself is alluded to in another verse, “A wakeful, holy angel descended from Heaven (עיר וקדיש מן שמיא נחית, Ir Ve-kaddish Min Shemaya Nachit)” (Daniel 4:10), the first letters of which spell ShIMON. The following prayer is based on the awesome secret that Rebbe Nachman revealed regarding the greatness of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who promised the Jewish people that through him, the Torah would not be forgotten — because “with this Zohar, they will be redeemed from exile.” If a person has the privilege of being at Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai’s holy gravesite, it is good to recite this prayer there. However, one does well to recite it anywhere, because — as the holy Zohar states — the Tzaddik’s soul spreads throughout the entire world."

31,21,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 7-8","“Since it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring, for I know what plan they are devising” [31:21]. (The entire text from here to note 13 is one commentary. I was not able to find an author and it may well be by the author of the Ze’enah U-Re’enah.)  The Holy One said: the warning that is written in the Torah to Israel, that they should study Torah, will not be forgotten. The Holy One also said: the evil inclination of Israel is evil. It incites them to commit sins. Therefore, remember to repent, particularly now it is time to repent. The one who has regret for sins; he must mention the sin with his mouth. He needs to bring no other sacrifices, as the Talmud says in, [tractate Yoma] chapter eight. Rabbi Isaac said: the Holy One and His attributes are unlike those of people. When one person becomes angry with another, there is a question if he will be able to be reconciled with him. He does not know if he can reconcile with money or with words. However, with the Holy One, he will certainly be reconciled with words, as the verse says, “take words with you” [Hosea, 14:3]. (B. Yoma, 86b.)  This means, take good words with you to repent. The Talmud says in the first chapter of tractate Sotah. Judah confessed that he had slept with Tamar, his daughter-in-law. Thus, he was worthy of the world to come. (B. Sotah, 7b.)  Reuben also repented for throwing out Bilhah’s bed. When Rachel died, Jacob took Rachel’s bed and placed it in Bilhah’s room. Reuben went and took the bed and threw it out and said: you are a servant, how do you want to inherit Rachel’s bed, which was important? Jacob was angry and therefore Reuben repented and the Holy One forgave him, so that he had a share in the world to come. (B. Shabbat, 55b.)  The person must explicitly state the sins that he has committed against the people, so that the people know about the sin, expecting that the people should see that he has repented. However, if it is a sin against God alone that the people do not know about, he must quietly say before God. Rabbi Yannai said: there were two good leaders for Israel, Moses and David. Moses, who said before God that they should write down his sins, so that people will know what sins he had committed, as the verse says, “because you did not trust me” [Numbers, 20:12]. Because you did not believe in me, therefore you must die. David said that they should not write his sins. (B. Yoma, 86b.)  How are Moses and David similar? A parable. Two women sinned. One of them engaged in illicit sexual relations and the other one ate figs that were forbidden to be eaten. Both of them were punished for their sins. Both of them were punished for their sins. The woman who ate the figs called out. I ask you: let them announce my sin so that people should not think that I have committed a great sin, like my colleague. They hung a fig on that woman and called out that she had eaten figs during a time when it was forbidden. Therefore, we recite [the prayer] for the sin [Al Het] on Yom Kippur, since all the sins are written in for the sin. Therefore, it is good that the woman who does not understand Hebrew, should be careful to recite the for the sin [Al Het] in Yiddish, expecting that when she will come to the sin that she committed that year, she will take it to heart that she did this and will cry and plead with God that He should forgive her. She will never again do it. However, when she does not understand, she will forget what she had done and would not plead about it, since the person must be sad in his heart for the sin that he did. His repentance is better than many tears, as the verse says, “God, you will not despise a contrite and crushed heart” [Psalms, 51:19]. This means, a broken heart and sadness do not embarrass God. When someone has committed a sin with his eye, that he saw what he should not see, he should cry and be sad and shed tears, since the tears and crying greatly help repentance. Our sages said: since the destruction of the Temple, the gates of prayer have been closed in heaven, but in any event the gate where the tears enter heaven are open in heaven. Just as when the body is sick, he searches for a remedy so that the illness should go away. He must also do this when the soul is sick, he must search for its remedies. When his soul is sick and desires to have much money, then he must become accustomed to giving charity and must not be stingy in giving charity. Through this, the desire for money will be removed. He should think that much good and evil comes from the money. When his soul is accustomed to pursue arrogance and haughtiness, then he must accustom himself to be humble. He should walk stooped and must think about death and how the worms will eat him in the grave. He must pursue this for a long time and through this he will become accustomed to restore this trait. The book Rokeach writes that there are four kinds of repentance. (Eleazar of Worms, Sefer Rokeach, Hilkhot Teshuvah.)  One is called the repentance of offering. This means, we he committed a sin with a married woman, and he encounters the same woman again, and he again desires her, and there is a place where he can again have a liaison with her, and he compels his evil inclination [not to sin], this is called the repentance of offering. The second form of repentance is called the repentance of the fence. This means, he makes himself a fence to the sin. He does not look at any woman and does not look at her clothes, or when the women dance. It is evident that he should not dance with them. The sin cannot be bigger; Gehenna is too small for him. The third form of repentance is called proportionate repentance. This means, the pleasure that he had from the sin, so too he must torment himself. He must fast and should not eat meat and not drink wine, except for festivals. He should not bathe himself, except for festivals. He should not go to banquets and should give himself lashes. He should not lie on a pillow, except on festivals and on the Sabbath. The fourth form of repentance is the repentance of the biblical text. This means, the one who slept with a married woman must suffer great anguish that should be as severe as death. He should sit in the cold on the ice, or in the water, or in the snow, for an hour every day. In the summer he should sit amidst flies, or mice, or bees. He should be further warned that he should not speak with women. He should repent for the sin every day, because he made that woman forbidden to her husband. He must suffer great pains, since he had persuaded a married woman. Thus, this woman is forbidden to her husband. However, when he slept with a married woman by force, that woman is not forbidden to her husband. Then he does not need more than to allow himself to receive lashes and must fast for forty days, and must lie on the ground. He should not bathe and should not attend celebrations. He must recite the confession three times with tears and mourning. If he slept with a woman who was not married, he should think that she was a menstruant because she had not immersed herself for him. He must lie on the ground and must allow himself to receive lashes every day and must fast for forty days and must confess the sin every day three times and should also not go to any celebrations. If he slept with a gentile woman, he must fast, receive lashes, eat no meat and drink no wine, and not bathe for forty days. If he stole something from his friend and had regret, he must return it to him or his heirs and should confess. He should abstain in the future from the money of strangers and should give much charity. He should ask forgiveness from the one he had stolen from, etc. The person should confess to repent and overcome his evil inclination. Therefore, the verse in the portion said, “for I know his plans” [31:21]. This means, I know well the thoughts of the person. When the troubles will come upon the person, the song will testify that I have warned him. From here our sages learn that in the end when the Messiah will come, the commandments of the Torah will be ended, since when the evil inclination will be abrogated, then the Torah will also be abrogated, but Purim will never be abrogated even when the Messiah will come. (The commentary to Deuteronomy, 31:21, ends here.) "
31,21,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Vayeilech 9","“Since it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring, for I know their plans” [31:21]. The Torah would not be forgotten. Therefore, when the evil inclination is with them, but when the evil inclination will disappear in the days of the Messiah, then no Torah will be needed. This means that the resurrection of the dead will occur long after the Messiah, since the Messiah will come first before the resurrection of the dead. Therefore, one should repent. One should know that the Holy One has warned us that we should be pious. Then the Holy One will send us the Messiah. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 31:21.) "
31,21,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:21:1","וענתה השירה הזאת, “and this song shall testify before them as a witness;” we must imagine this as if the “song” will reply to those who say “why have all these disasters befallen us?”"
31,21,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:21:2","לפניו, “in response to this;”"
31,21,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:21:3","כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו, “it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of their offspring;” although there are many chastisements, eventually this will end in words of comfort."
31,21,Talmud,Chagigah 5a:15,"Additionally, when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “Then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them” (Deuteronomy 31:21). He said: With regard to a slave whose master brings upon him evils and troubles, is there a remedy for him?"
31,21,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 42:3,"Another interpretation, “it was in the days of Amrafel” – Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: The following exposition was brought with us in our hands when we came up from the Diaspora: (When the exiles of Israel returned to the land of Israel with Ezra from Babylon.)  Wherever it is stated: “It was [vayhi] in the days,” it indicates trouble. (Vayhi is seen as a combination of the words vay and hi, both expressions of woe and misfortune.)  “It was in the days of Amrafel” – what was the trouble there? “They waged war” (Genesis 14:2). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: There are five such instances. (For the other four instances, see: Isaiah 7:1; Jeremiah 1:3; Ruth 1:1; Esther 1:1.)   This is analogous to a friend of a king who lived in a certain province, and for his sake the king took an interest in that province. Once some barbarians came to attack him, and they said: ‘Woe unto us, as the king will not show favor to the province as was his wont if they kill his friend.’ That is what is written: “They turned back, and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7) – Rabbi Aḥa said: They came only to fight against the eyeball [ein] of the world; (Abraham is called the eyeball of the world, because it was only for his sake that God took an interest in and looked out for the benefit of the people of the world.)  they sought to blind the eye [ayin] that overcame the attribute of justice [mishpat] in the world. “Which is [hi] Kadesh” – Rav Aḥa said: Hu is written. It is he [hu] who sanctified [kiddesh] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace. When the barbarians came to attack him, everyone began crying out: ‘Woe [vay].’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days of Amrafel.”  “It was in the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). (Israel was under attack from all sides.)  This is analogous to a king’s son, whose caretaker resolved to kill him. He said: ‘If I kill him, I will be liable to execution by the king. Instead, I will take away his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own.’ So, too, Aḥaz said: ‘If there are no kids, there will be no goats, and if there are no goats there will be no flock, and if there is no flock there will be no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, there will be no world.’ (That is, the world will not be able to function in its conventional manner.)  That is what Aḥaz thought to himself: ‘If there are no children [in school], there will be no students, if there are no students there will be no scholars, if there are no scholars there will be no elders, if there are no elders there will be no prophets, if there are no prophets the Holy One blessed be He will not rest His Divine Presence upon them [Israel]. (Consequently, he closed all the schools.)  That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).  Rabbi Ḥonya bar Rabbi Elazar said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he locked up [aḥaz] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Isaiah said: ‘“I will hope for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no moment that was as grim as that time, in whose regard it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But at that very time, I [Isaiah] hoped for Him, as it is written [immediately afterwards]: “For it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). (When God said that He would hide His face from Israel, He continued, that nevertheless the Torah would never be forgotten by them.)  Of what use was it to him [Ahaz]? (Despite his best efforts, the Torah continued to be taught, as the Midrash goes on to explain.)  [Of no use, as Isaiah declared:] “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord gave me, are to become signs and wonders in Israel”’ (Isaiah 8:18). Were they (The young men Isaiah was referring to.)  his children? Were they not actually his students? However, we learn from here that they [his students] were as beloved to him as sons. When he [Aḥaz] locked up the synagogues and study halls, people began crying out: ‘Woe [vay]’ – “it was [vayhi] in the days of Aḥaz.”  “It was in the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? [It was as Jeremiah prophesied:] “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to a king who sent a proclamation throughout the province. What did the residents of one province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. Thus it is stated: “It happened that as Yehudi would read three or four sections…” (Jeremiah 36:23) (It was the Book of Lamentations that was being read.)  – this means three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse, “Its besiegers have become dominant” (Lamentations 1:5) – “He cut it up with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). When everyone saw this, they began crying out: ‘Woe [vay]’ – “it was [vayhi] in the days of Yehoyakim.”  “It was in the days that the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) (A more literal translation would be, “in the days of the judging of the judges.”)  – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). This is analogous to a province that owed a tax to the king. The prince sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do to him? They took him and beat him. They then said: ‘Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these events; what he sought to do to us, (Subdue us.)  we did to him.’ So, too, in the days of the judging of the judges – when a person of Israel would engage in idol worship, and the judge sought to implement against him the attribute of strict justice, (And decree for him corporal punishment.)  he would come and flog the judge. He said: ‘What he sought to do to me, I did to him.’ (“The judging of the judges” is interpreted to mean that the people committed acts of judgment and punishment against their judges.)  They said: ‘Woe [vay] to the generation that judges its judges.’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).  “It was in the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [Haman’s decree:] “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate [all the Jews]” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a certain vineyard, and three enemies rose up against it. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began cutting off the clusters, and the third began uprooting the vines. So too, Pharaoh [said]: “Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). Nebuchadnezzar [exiled] “the ḥarash and the masger, (These are two classes of Torah scholars (Gittin 88a).)  one thousand” (Jeremiah 29:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: One thousand ḥarash and one thousand masger; the Rabbis said: They were one thousand altogether. Haman sought to uproot the entire vineyard, as it is stated: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews…” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began crying out: ‘Woe [vay].’ That is what is written: “It was [vayhi] in the days of Aḥashverosh.”  Rabbi Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that vayhi is stated it refers either to trouble or to joy; if the context is one of trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is one of joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and made a distinction: Everywhere that vayhi is stated, (Even when it is not connected with “in the days of.”)  it alludes to trouble, and vehaya [alludes to] joy.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “And there was [vayhi] light”? (Genesis 1:3). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as the world was not privileged to use that light. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, He hid it away for the righteous in the future. That is what is written: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light, growing brighter until the day is established” (Proverbs 4:18).  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, one day”? (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wear away, as it is stated: “For the heavens will vanish like smoke and the earth will wear away like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6).  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8), “…a third day” (Genesis 1:13), “a fourth day” (Genesis 1:19), “a fifth day” (Genesis 1:23), “a sixth day”? (Genesis 1:31). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete [joy], as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires some act [to perfect it], e.g., mustard requires sweetening, wheat requires grinding, and lupines require sweetening.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joseph”? (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as that bear (Potifar’s wife.)  then accosted him.  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] on the eighth day, Moses summoned”? (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as Nadav and Avihu died [that day].  They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle”? (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That was nevertheless not [complete] joy, as it was hidden away with the building of the Temple. (Moses’ Tabernacle was stored away forever when the permanent Temple was built.)   They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “The Lord was [vayhi] with Joshua”? (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That was nevertheless not [complete] joy, as it became necessary for him to rend his garments. (Joshua 7:6.)    They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [vayhi] when the king (David.)  resided in his house, and the Lord had given him respite…”? (II Samuel 7:1). He said to them: It was nevertheless not complete joy, as Natan then came and said to him: “However, you will not build the House…for My name” (I Kings 8:19).  They said to him: We have said our [arguments], now you say yours. He said to them, (To prove his contention that vehaya always alludes to a joyous event.)  is it not written: “It will be [vehaya] on that day that spring water will emerge…” (Zechariah 14:8). It will be [vehaya] on that day, each man will keep a calf of the herd…” (Isaiah 7:21). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be on that day that the Lord will continue…[to acquire the remnant of His people]” (Isaiah 11:11). “It will be [vehaya] on that day, a great shofar will be sounded…” (Isaiah 27:13).   They raised an objection to him: “And it was [vehaya] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: That was nevertheless joyous, as on that day, Israel gained atonement for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel gained great atonement for their iniquities on the day that the Temple was destroyed, as it is stated: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion, He will not continue to exile you again” (Lamentations 4:22)."
31,21,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 11:1:17,"""The sons of G-d,"" describes people who lived an undisturbed long and good life, pampering themselves. The ready availability of women to cater to their needs, reinforced that mode of existence. The length of a lifetime in those days was necessary in order for people to begin to understand nature, based on long term observations of the phenomena, experiments etc. Later generations, having at their disposal the benefit of knowledge gathered by their ancestors, did not need such a lengthy lifespan. Moses in Psalms 90,10 already states that seventy years nowadays is enough for man to achieve the objectives G-d has set man. Since the descendants of Shet are properly called ""the sons of the Divine,"" while the daughters of ""Adam"" are obviously descendants of Cain, their intermarrying was bound to lead to catastrophic consequences. When G-d reacts by saying (Genesis 6,3), ""My spirit will not dwell within man ever,"" it means that He will not go on forever making excuses for them-- ""seeing that they are made of flesh""-- as He had done in suspending sentence on their ancestor Cain. Since the people who now perpetrate all these evils are descended from a superior branch of mankind, their relapses are far less excusable. What could G-d expect from them in the future then? Therefore, G-d gave them a time limit of 120 years. This is the meaning of Psalm 82,6, ""I had said that you are G-d like, but you will die like earth bound beings."" The timing of the deluge was arranged so that the good people who, though not worth saving, were not as guilty as the others, would have died due to normal circumstances. The fact that the chain of descendants of Shet who are mentioned by name are all recorded as having died, is proof that their death left some void. The descendants of Noach, starting with Shem are not recorded as having died. Possibly, this is to distinguish those ten generations from the ones between Adam and Noach. The reference to the nephilim is (a) to insure that the men described as ""sons of G-d"" are not confused with beings that have been sired by G-d; (b) to account for the fact that we find some descendants of the generation of the deluge having survived till the era of Moses, such as the giant Og, for instance. These people encountered by Israel in the desert some 700 years later were understandably viewed as ""sons of G-d"" by dint of their genealogy. ""When G-d saw that the evil perpetrated by man on the earth was great, and that all his thought processes were evil all day long, He regretted that He had made man"" (Genesis 6,5-6). Philosophers distinguish between evil as merely an act, and evil which had been both planned and executed. The person who commits the former can reform easily, since his thought processes have remained unaffected and can be employed to help control his actions. Not so when the evil is the product of one's thought processes. What counterweight is there then for such a person to achieve rehabilitation? It is this latter evil G-d encountered in man, and which the verse in question comments upon. Although a complete comprehension of the line ""G-d regretted"" is impossible unless one subscribes to the theory that Torah on occasion employs a human mode of speech when describing anthropomorphous actions by G-d (Kidushin 17), we will try and explain the meaning of vayinachem here and elsewhere when G-d is the subject of that term. Hitnachmut, regrets, is not a change of viewpoint when the premise for that viewpoint has remained constant. Rather, it is a re-consideration of one's plans and attitudes based on a changed set of circumstances. If a person vows to do good to a friend because he has faith in that friend's loyalty, and the friend turns into an enemy, then the cancellation of his vow to do good does not constitute a change of mind, a breaking of one's promise. Rather, it is an admission that one had erred in one's assessment of the facts which one's promise had been based on. A changed attitude then becomes an act of wisdom, a rejection of foolishness. If, on the other hand, the eventual disloyalty of the friend to whom one had vowed assistance, is foreseen, and occurs in accordance with one's expectations, then the act of having to withhold one's assistance becomes an act of regret, reconsideration. This latter regret, i.e. going back on one's promise, is considered a major character defect in human society. Therefore, those guilty of such behavior prefer to explain their actions as being the result of their own stupidity, shortsightedness. A case in point is Bileam (Numbers 22,34). He said to the angel, ""I have sinned since I have been unaware."" Since one cannot presume lack of foreknowledge on the part of G-d, He chose to describe His resolution as an act of reconsideration rather than as an act resulting from lack of foreknowledge. When the Torah describes G-d as having reconsidered, it tells us that G-d continued to desire that He could carry out what He had originally planned, but what had now become impossible due to the conduct of the other half of the partnership between G-d and Man. In the same way G-d predicts in Deuteronomy 31, the Jewish people's corruption and the steps He would have to take to deal with that problem. In order to ensure the eventual production of the perfect tree, the planting of many trees is necessary, until eventually the perfect one will emerge. Should this not occur, refinement of the relatively best trees will lead to their eventually producing the perfect tree. G-d proceeded along similar lines with mankind. When no perfect specimen showed up after a lengthy period, the time had come to abandon earlier crops and retain only the relatively best and start the process of proliferation afresh with those specimen. This time only the seeds of the best trees which had been produced thus far were used. Although such contingencies had been part of His planning, the need to resort to them was a saddening experience. "
31,21,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 16:1:4,"In particular, all his intellectual faculties, though G-d given, do not necessarily lead him to the right conclusions. In order to progress from ignorance toward understanding the works of G-d, one must understand the laws of nature as manifest in our universe; subsequently, one may acquire some insights into the workings of the Divine. Chapter thirty in Proverbs illustrates that man without the assistance of G-d is naught. ""Agur"" describes himself as ignorant, possessing neither knowledge of the natural sciences nor knowledge of the metaphysical. His very name indicates that he is desirous of amassing knowledge. The same applies to his partner ""Ittiel,"" who desires close communion with G-d. The thrust of the message is that as long as no one has offered prophetic insight, ""Who ascended to heaven?"" ""What is my name or the name of my son?"" i.e. I amount to nothing as long as I am not in possession of inside knowledge of our tradition. The entire chapter outlines the handicaps someone like Abraham labors under when he endeavors to discover truth, not having the revealed word of G-d to assist him in his quest. The only path which is guaranteed to lead to success is ""the word of the Lord is refined, pure"" (Proverbs 30,5). If our faculties are inadequate to reveal to us the truths about the workings of the physical universe, how much less adequate are they to make us privy to the workings of the spiritual spheres (Isaiah 44,24)? The prophet, in describing G-d’s exclusive involvement in developing the physical universe and asking ""Who is with Me?"" i.e. ""Who helped Me?"", makes it clear that man's insight into the heavenly part of the universe is even less imaginable. "
31,21,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 2:1:25,"Hashem promised that the Torah will never be forgotten completely from the Jewish people (Rashi to Devarim 31:21). Thus, even if we will willingly cast off the Torah, Hashem will ensure that it is not completely forgotten, just as He did not permit Yonah to let himself be destroyed. Hashem might not intervene and save an individual Jew from destroying himself either physically or spiritually. However, He most certainly will intervene and not permit the total physical or spiritual elimination of Am Yisrael."
31,21,Quoting Commentary,Chidushei Agadot on Gittin 56b:11,"And it said, He said to him, ""Their words (commandments) are numerous, and you will not be able, etc."": He denied that the Torah was from the Heavens: For it is impossible that it be from the Heavens, since it is impossible to fulfill all of it; and its words are like words in general. And there is also a hint to this in that [Psalm]. As it stated further (Psalms 74:18), ""Remember this, O enemy who blasphemes the Lord, etc."" As it states (Psalms 74:19), ""Do not deliver [Your dove] to the wild animal"" - which is Israel, Your dove, as I have written. For it is impossible to keep it all, since forgetfulness is found among people. So ""do not forget forever,"" the answer that You promised us, ""your poor ones"" - which are Israel. It is as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:21), ""for it shall never be forgotten from the lips of their progeny, etc."" And it said, ""Anyone who distresses Israel will become, etc."" - that is explained in the Aggadot of [the chapter entitled] Chelek."
31,21,Midrash,Aggadat Bereshit 60:1,"Chapter (59) 60: Psalms [1] ""A song of ascents. Many times they have afflicted me from my youth,"" let Israel say (Psalm 129:1). And it shall be, when you find yourself in great distress and tribulation, this song shall bear witness against you (Deuteronomy 31:21). The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""When Israel finds itself in such troubles and I deliver them from it, at that moment they shall sing a song,"" as it is said, ""Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord"" (Exodus 15:1). This is also true when they were in Egypt and were enslaved; once they were saved and sat down to eat, they immediately sang a song, as it is said, ""You will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept"" (Isaiah 30:29). On that same night, it is said, ""a night of watching"" (Exodus 12:42). This is also true at the sea, when they were in great distress, as it is said, ""They crossed the sea through great trial"" (Zechariah 10:11), and when God performed miracles and saved them, they immediately sang a song, as it is said, ""And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord, and believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant"" (Exodus 14:31). Immediately after that they sang, ""Then sang Moses and the children of Israel"" (Exodus 15:1). When they came to the wilderness and were thirsty, as it is said, ""Their soul fainted within them"" (Psalm 107:5), and they cried out to the Lord, when they saw the well of water, they immediately sang a song, as it is said, ""Then Israel sang this song, 'Spring up, O well'"" (Numbers 21:17-18). Therefore, it is written, ""And it shall be, when you find yourself in great distress"" (Deuteronomy 31:21), and so it was with Deborah and Barak when Sisera oppressed them, as it is said, ""And Sisera called together all his chariots"" (Judges 4:13), and when the Holy One, blessed be He, delivered them, immediately Deborah sang, as it is said, ""Then Deborah sang"" (Judges 5:1). Similarly, when Sennacherib came, Hezekiah said, ""And my song shall be with you"" (Isaiah 38:20).  And so with David, when troubles came upon him, as it says, ""For troubles without number surround me"" (Psalm 40:13), and once the Almighty saved him from all of them, immediately he said a song, as it says, ""These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and his servants"" (2 Samuel 21:22), ""Then David spoke to the Lord the words of this song"" (2 Samuel 22:1). Therefore, it says, ""And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, this song shall testify before them"" (Deuteronomy 31:21), therefore we say in Psalm 129:1, ""Many times they have oppressed me from my youth."""

31,22,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Deuteronomy, Ha'Azinu 1","Deuteronomy 31,22-24 “Moses wrote down this ‘song’ ‎in a book until its conclusion.”  Our sages in ‎‎Pessachim> 87 state that the only reason that the Jewish ‎people were exiled and scattered among the various nations ‎‎[instead of being banished to a large but unpopulated ‎island, Ed.] is in order for their presence to attract ‎worthy people amongst the gentiles to have a chance to convert ‎to Judaism. Only the Israelites are able to help these “sparks” of ‎holy spirits among the gentiles which have “fallen” from their ‎celestial home to rehabilitate themselves through becoming ‎attached to the Jewish nation. [Our author has belaboured ‎this concept on several occasions. Ed.] This is also why ‎the words Moses addresses to his nation on this occasion have ‎been entitled “‎שירה‎,” “song,” expressing one’s feelings of joy ‎poetically. This is so in spite of the fact that the Israelites at the ‎time are in exile on foreign soil, and may be presumed not to feel ‎joyous at all. The positive aspects to exile, which are exclusive to ‎exile, actually are a joyful experience, as, once the “lost souls,” i.e. ‎‎“sparks“ of spirituality scattered among the gentile people have ‎been repatriated, there is nothing to hinder G’d from annihilating ‎the remainder of these people.‎"
31,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:19:1,"AND NOW WRITE YE THIS SONG. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, He commands both Moses and Joshua to write it for He wanted to make Joshua His prophet during Moses’ lifetime. Now, Moses wrote it while Joshua stood by him, read it, and saw [it completed], this being the sense of the verse, So Moses wrote this Song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. (Further, Verse 22.)  It refers to Moses who was the principal [in the writing of the Song] for it was from him that they would hear it and learn it, although Joshua, too, taught it with him, as it is stated at the conclusion [of the chapter] he [i.e., Moses], and Hoshea, the son of Nun. (Further, 32:44.)  Now, the meaning of the expression this Song is “the Song that I will now tell you,” this being ‘Ha’azinu’ (Give ear). (Ibid., Verses 1-43.)  It is called Song because Israel would recite it with song and psalm. (At the Divine Service in the Sanctuary, a section of the Song of Ha’azinu was chanted each Sabbath during the Service of the Additional Offering. The cycle of the Song was completed every six weeks. Therefore, the six divisions (Aliyoth) in the reading of this Song in the Synagogue on the Sabbath of Ha’azinu, follow the same divisions as sung in the Sanctuary (Rosh Hashanah 31a).)  It was also written [in the Torah] in the style of a song, since songs are written with interruptions [empty spaces] indicating the places of chanting."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

And in the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra: (Found in Ibn Ezra on Verse 15.)  “And he commanded Joshua — that is, Moses [commanded] by order of G-d, and therefore he said, into the Land which I swore unto them.” Similarly we find that Moses said, And I will give the rain of your Land in its season.

The Holy One, blessed be He, however, said to Joshua, (v. 23) “For thou shalt bring (תביא) the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them” — thou shalt bring them even against their will; everything depends on you alone: if necessary take a stick and beat them over the head: there can be but one leader for a generation, and not two leaders for a generation (Sanhedrin 8a)."
31,23,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 12:23:1","רק חזק לבלתי אכול הדם, “only remain steadfast not to consume the blood!” Our sages quote this line as proof that the Israelites had been deeply steeped in blood. [The prohibition against eating blood is repeated 7 times in the Torah. Ed.] Nachmanides writes that although the reason given by the Torah here and elsewhere for not eating blood, i.e. that it is equivalent to eating the animal’s life-force, its “animalistic soul,” is certainly adequate, and justifies the many repetitions of that prohibition, he, personally, does not feel satisfied with this reason. There must be some additional reason for Moses exhorting the people by calling out “only remain steadfast, etc.” What is the special steadfastness and faith that Moses believes is necessary in order to withstand the supposed allure of eating blood? Expressions such as the one used by Moses here are normally used when someone is encouraged to keep his courage when going to war, as Moses himself used when he charged Joshua with the task of leading the people after he had gone. (Compare Deut. 31,23) We find such exhortations when they concern the whole range of commandments, but never when they concern the observance of only a single commandment, and especially a negative commandment where one is not required to do something but is only required to refrain from initiating an act of rebellion against G’d!
    But it appears to me that Moses employed this expression because he was aware to what extent the Israelites, while still in Egypt, had clung to this particular kind of idolatrous practice. They had slaughtered animals to these deities, for why else would the Torah in Leviticus 17,7 have accused them of having done so by writing; “so that they will not continue to slaughter to the satyrs, etc.?” They had gathered the blood of these animals in order to present them to the demons and had eaten some of the blood. By doing so they were considered as if they had called upon these demons, especially in order to have their future foretold for them.
    Clearly, that was not the major reason why the Torah prohibited the eating of blood. The Torah has revealed that reason repeatedly when referring to the blood representing the essence of life, and that we must not eat it, as we would absorb too much animalistic “genes” by doing so. G’d has arranged things so that by presenting the animal’s blood to Him on the Altar, it atones for our cardinal sins, resurrects us in a manner of speaking, instead of us becoming more like animals. The Torah was concerned that people who had their future foretold by them after eating blood, and the predictions had come true, that this would be a strong stimulant for other people copying such practices, and it requires great fortitude to withstand such a temptation.

31,23,Talmud,Sanhedrin 8a:7,"Similarly, a distinction is drawn between two verses where Moses commanded Joshua concerning his impending leadership: It is written: “For you shall go with these people into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:7), and it is written: “For you shall bring the children of Israel into the land” (Deuteronomy 31:23). Rabbi Yoḥanan reconciled the difference between these two charges and said: Moses said to Joshua, in the first verse: You and the elders of the generation will enter into Eretz Yisrael together with the people, i.e., the elders will assist you in the leadership. Subsequently, in the second verse, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Joshua: You yourself must bring the people: Take a rod and strike the people upon their skulls. There must be one clear and authoritative leader for the generation, and there may not be two or more leaders for the generation."
31,23,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:23:1","This reverts to the text above, etc. That is, it refers back to above (v. 16), Hashem said to Moshe, ‘You are about to die, etc.' and after He concluded His words with Moshe, He commanded Yehoshua. But it is not connected to [v. 22] Moshe wrote, etc. for if so, that Moshe is the one commanding, it should have said That He swore to them and not That I swore to them. But Rashi was unable to prove this from the words, And I shall be with you which should have been written as And He shall be with you if Moshe was the one giving the commandment, because one could explain that I will be with you means my merit will be with you. Therefore Rashi was forced to prove this point from [the verse] that I swore. But were it not written, that I swore, we would have explained that [the words] For you will bring refers to Moshe, that Moshe is commanding Yehoshua. And the reason that he said above [v. 7] That you will enter, etc. is merely as advice. Therefore Rashi proves that it refers to the Divine Presence from the word That I swore.

31,23,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Joshua 7:10:1,"Get yourself up. [Even though we read the word as קֻם], it is written קם [which could be read קָם]. [The explanation therefore would be as follows]: Your prayers to Me have stood up for you, and [everything] you mentioned. (Your prayers and everything you said have accomplished their purpose. I will not permit the people to be defeated.)  Another explanation: you stood yourself in the camp and did not go out with them, (When you sent the men to capture the city of Ai, you remained at the camp and did not lead them.)  and I had said, ‘Who will take them out [to war] and who will bring them [back].’ (Bamidbar 27:17.)  ‘For you will bring the Bnei Yisroel— and I will be with you.’ (Devorim 31:23.)  ‘For he will cross over before this people, and he will spur them on to inherit.’ (Devorim 3:28.)  If you go before them, they will succeed, and if not, they will not succeed. Another explanation: Get yourself up, it is your fault [because of you] that this has happened to them. I did not tell you to sanctify the booty of the city."

31,23,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:14:1,"THAT I MAY GIVE HIM [Joshua] A CHARGE. “This means that I may exhort him.” This is Rashi’s language. But there is no need for this, because G-d’s statement [to Joshua] for thou shalt bring [the children of Israel into the Land] (Further, Verse 23.)  is a command, and, if he were to be indolent and not do so, he would be liable to the death-penalty. It is possible that the meaning of that I may give him a charge is that I will appoint him a prince and commander (Isaiah 55:4.)  over Israel, and thou shalt give him a charge in their sight. (Numbers 27:19.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,24,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:24:1,"AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED WRITING [THE WORDS OF THIS LAW]. The meaning thereof is that, at first, he wrote the Law and delivered it unto the priests as is stated above, (Above, Verse 9.)  but he did not tell them where they were to put it. Afterwards he was commanded concerning this Song — he wrote it and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  that same day, and thus added it to the Law. And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing everything in the Book of the Law, then he commanded the priests, Take this Book of the Law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d, (Verse 26.)  meaning that it should remain in the ark at the side [of the Tablets], for henceforth they would not even touch it to add [thereto] or to diminish [from it]. This is the sense of the verse, And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing [the words of this Law in a book] until they were completed. Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [Seder] V’zoth Habrachah (Further, Chapter 33.)  was [written] earlier, and its proper place is above as it is stated And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel. (Above, Verse 1. Ibn Ezra holds that at the time when he informed them of his impending death, he also blessed them, as recorded in Seder V’zoth Habrachah.)  It is possible that after he wrote the Song and taught it the children of Israel (Verse 22.)  one by one according to their tribes as he had them brought before him to the House of Learning, he wrote it in the Book of the Law and commanded the priests Take this Book of the Law, (Verse 26.)  meaning that the Song too, should remain in the ark with the Law, for it is part of the Law since it is there as a testimony. Then Moses told them to assemble before him again — all the elders of the tribes and the officers (See further, Verse 28.)  — and that the people should join them, for so it is stated at the end, And Moses came and spoke all the words of this Song in the ears of the people. (Further, 32:44.)  Now the priests did so and they assembled the entire people before him and he called heaven and earth to witness against them in assembly (Thus in addition to teaching the Song to the individual tribes, he now taught it again in an assembly of the entire people.)  in the hearing of the priests and all the people. Then G-d, blessed be He, told him Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim. (Ibid., Verse 49.)  This he was bound to do immediately, and so he stood up and blessed them: ‘V’zoth Habrachah’ (And this is the blessing). (Ibid., 33:1.)  He then wrote it at the end of the book which he gave to the priests. Then the priests did as he commanded them — they placed the complete book by the side of the ark of the covenant. (In accordance with Ramban’s interpretation at the beginning of the verse that the Law was placed “in the ark at the side [of the Tablets]” the language here too must mean: “[inside] by the side of the ark of the covenant.” This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir (Baba Bathra 14a).)  Thus everything took place in the order stated in the Torah. (See a similar approach of Ramban in Leviticus 8:2 (Vol. III, p. 91-93).)  Ha’azinu"

31,24,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 31:24:1","ויהי ככלות משה לכתוב, “When Moses had finished writing, etc.;” according to Nachmanides, Moses first wrote a Torah scroll which he handed to the priests as mentioned earlier, (verse 9) at which time he had not yet told them where to deposit that scroll. Following that, he had been commanded to commit the “song” to parchment, and he wrote it down and taught it to the Children of Israel on that very same day. He then added that section to the Torah scroll he had written previously. Having completed this, he issued the order to the priests to deposit the whole Torah scroll inside the Holy Ark next two the two Tablets with the Ten Commandments. From that moment on, neither the Tablets nor that Torah scroll were touched again, so as to preserve the text inviolate, no one being able to claim that anything had either been added or erased. This is why Ibn Ezra says that the last portion in our scrolls of the Torah, the portion known as וזאת הברכה, must have been written before the song portion in האזינו, immediately after the verse in our portion in which Moses announces that G’d had told him that the period of his leadership of the people was drawing to an end. When he took his leave from the people he also blessed them after announcing that he was about to die.
    Alternatively, it is possible that he went around to the people after he had completed writing the song in haazinu and took that opportunity to familiarize the people with it, each tribe separately. In that event, this song too would have been placed inside the Holy Ark, next to the original Torah scroll and the two Tablets. The “song” would serve as the witness that Moses had spoken about in This would correspond to 32,44 where Moses is reported as reading out the song before the assembled people, flanked by Joshua. The priests had assembled the people for that purpose. Immediately after that ceremony G’d told Moses (32,49) to ascend Mount Nebo in preparation for his departure from this world. Moses immediately complied with that order and began to dispense his final blessings to the various tribes. Having done so, he also committed these blessings to writing as an appendix to the Torah that he had already given to the priests in order for them to deposit it as a complete book next to the Tablets in the Holy Ark. If this had indeed been the procedure, it would correspond to the order in which matters are recorded in our version of the Torah.

31,24,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vayechi 2:8","Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years, while Moses lived only one hundred and twenty. Hence it is written about him: Behold, thy days draw near that thou must die (Deut. 31:24). And drew near is written with reference to Jacob, and he did not attain the age of his forebears. Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years, and Isaac lived one hundred and eighty years, while Jacob lived only one hundred and forty-seven years.

The third was at the well: Then Israel sang this song (Num. 21:16). The fourth took place when Moses said: And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing (Deut. 31:24).

Did David actually dedicate the House (Temple)? The fact is that Solomon dedicated it, but inasmuch as David had set his heart upon erecting it, the song of dedication was ascribed to him. A similar example is contained in the verse And his sister stood far off (Exod. 2:4). Was she not the sister of both of them? Indeed she was, but inasmuch as she had devoted herself to Moses’ welfare, she is referred to by his name. Another instance of this is contained in the verse And the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers took (Gen. 34:25). Was she not the sister of each of the tribal ancestors? She was indeed, but because these two had devoted themselves to her welfare, she is mentioned with their names. Another illustration is contained in the verse Cozbi the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister (Num. 26:18). Was she actually a sister to all of them? (Hardly!) She was called their sister because she was deeply devoted to her people."
31,24,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Exodus 24:12:1","All 613 commandments are . . . in the Ten Commandments. [Rashi knows this] because it says, “[The Torah and the commandment] which I have written in order to teach them.” This cannot refer to the Torah scroll, because that was written by Moshe, not Hashem, as it says (Devarim 31:24): “When Moshe finished writing the words of this Torah in a book, till they were completed.” Thus we must say that this verse speaks of [God’s writing] the Ten Commandments, [which contain all the 613 mitzvos]. "
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on II Kings 22:8:1,"I have found the Torah Scroll. It was hidden under a layer of stones where they had concealed it when Achaz burned the Torah.

31,24,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 31:9:1,"AND MOSES WROTE THIS LAW — from the beginning of Bereshith to in the sight of all Israel. (Ibid., 34:12.)

Therefore, how can the expression this Law in Verse 9, refer to the entire Torah, while in Verse 11 the same expression refers to the Book of Deuteronomy? Ramban proceeds to answer this question.)  it refers to this Book of Deuteronomy, (Sotah 41a. Therefore, how can the expression this Law in Verse 9, refer to the entire Torah, while in Verse 11 the same expression refers to the Book of Deuteronomy? Ramban proceeds to answer this question.)  at this point, he reverted and explained, And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this Law in a book, until they were finished. (Further, Verse 24.)  This includes the entire Torah. [Hence the expression this Law in the verse before us means the entire Torah, while in the following Verse 11, concerning the reading in the Assembly, the same expression refers only to the Book of Deuteronomy.]"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

The reverse is true with, that Moses commanded the Levites…Take this book of the law…For I know thy rebellion (Deut. 31:25-27). (Here Moses is addressing the Levites, but part of what he says is directed to Israel.)  Moses did not address the Levites. (When he said, For I know thy rebellion…)  On the contrary, he spoke to all of Israel. (When he said, For I know thy rebellion…)  He addressed the Levites (The point is that some of what Moses said when he spoke to the Levites was directed specifically at the Levites, but the rest was directed to all of Israel. Moses could address Israel while speaking to the Levites because the Levites are part of Israel.)  because they are included in all of Israel."

31,26,Jewish Thought,Kuzari 2:30,"30. The Rabbi: Thou sayest rightly, but we are not even a body, only scattered limbs, like the 'dry bones' which Ezekiel saw [in his vision] (Ezekiel 37). These bones, however, O king of the Khazars, which have retained a trace of vital power, having once been the seat of a heart, brain, breath, soul, and intellect, are better than certain bodies formed of marble and plaster, endowed with heads, eyes, ears, and all limbs, in which never dwelt the spirit of life, nor ever can dwell in them, since they are but imitations of man, not man in reality."
31,26,Jewish Thought,Kuzari 2:28,"28. The Rabbi: Quite so. The root of all knowledge was deposited in the Ark which took the place of the heart, viz. the Ten Commandments, and its branch is the Tōrāh on its side, as it is said: 'Put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God' (Deuteronomy 31:26). From there went forth a twofold knowledge, firstly, the scriptural knowledge, whose bearers were the priests; secondly, the prophetic knowledge which was in the hands of the prophets. Both classes were, so to speak, the people's watchful advisers, who compiled the chronicles. They, therefore, represent the head of the people."
31,26,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:26:1,"והיה שם בך לעד, the written Torah, reposing in the Holy Ark is witness that I have predicted and warned against your abandoning G’d and His Torah. This is why I arranged for this testimony to be preserved in a place accessible even to the High Priest only once a year on the Day of Atonement. This original copy of the written Torah will, if need be,  prove that all that is written in all the Torah scrolls later and accessible to all the people all the time was a true copy of the Torah Moses had received from G’d at Mount Sinai. It will serve as proof that the Torah scrolls in circulation among the Torah scholars and the righteous people who commissioned copies for their private libraries, are all true to the original and do not contain additions or omissions.  It would appear, however, that the Torah scroll found by the High Priest Chilkiyah (Kings II 22,8) was the very one which Moses had handed over to the priests who carried the Ark across the river Jordan which we referred to earlier. It contained only the passage dealing with the legislation pertaining to the king. It was this scroll in which Joshua wrote (added) the renewal of G’d’s covenant with the people which took place at Shechem. This was the record of Israel’s renewed undertaking to serve the Lord. Compare Kings II 22,13 where King Yoshiyahu refers to this scroll containing matters not contained in Moses’ original Torah scroll, as Joshua had written part of this scroll after the covenant’s renewal in Shechem. The King had become painfully aware how far the people had strayed from their solemn undertaking.

31,26,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:26:1,לקח — The grammatical form and its meaning are the same as in (Exodus 20:8) זכור; (Deuteronomy 5:12) שמור; (Jeremiah 2:2) הלוך‎.
31,26,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:26:2,"מצד ארון ברית ה׳ [TAKE THIS BOOK OF THE LAW AND PUT IT] AT THE SIDE OF THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD — The sages of Israel differ about it (the meaning of the phrase “at the side of the Ark”) in Treatise Bava Batra 14a. Some of them say: A board projected from the Ark outside it and there it (the song) lay, whilst others say that it lay at the side of the Tablets within the Ark."
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 17:14:1,"WRITE THIS FOR A MEMORIAL IN THE BOOK. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented (This quote from Ibn Ezra is found in his commentary to Numbers 21:14. Part of it is also found here.)  that “this was a known book, namely, the book of the wars of the Eternal, (Numbers 21:14.)  which contained the history of the wars which G-d fought for those that fear Him, and it is possible that the history began from the time of Abraham.” There is nothing in these words of his but an opportunity [to say something without due consideration]. (It should be pointed out that in his commentary to the Book of Numbers (ibid), Ramban agrees with Ibn Ezra’s comment, by way of the plain meaning of Scripture. This is because it distinctly says there, the book of the wars of the Eternal. Here, however, it just says in the book. Hence Ramban rejects Ibn Ezra’s interpretation that here too it refers to that book of the wars of the Eternal, which is no longer extant, and he proposes his own interpretation, as explained in the text.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the word, baseifer (in the book), alludes to the Book of the Law, something like that which is written, Take this Book of the Law. (Deuteronomy 31:26.)  He is thus stating: “Write this in the Book of My Law so that the children of Israel should remember what Amalek did, for I will utterly blot out his remembrance, and I will lay My vengeance upon him by the hand of My people Israel.” (See Ezekiel 25:14.)  This is the commandment we find written in the Book of Deuteronomy: Remember what Amalek did unto thee. (Deuteronomy 25:17.)  He said, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua, to command him to remind Israel of all the travail that had come upon them because of Amalek, for he [Joshua] knows and is witness. (See Jeremiah 29:23.)  G-d is thus hinting that after the conquest of the Land, they would blot out Amalek, for the first commandment upon them was to destroy the seven nations (Deuteronomy 7:1-2.)  and take possession of the Land. This is Scripture’s intent in what is said there: And it shall be when the Eternal thy G-d hath given thee rest from all thine enemies… that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek. (Ibid., 25:19.)  Now had it been like this in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, he would have urged them on to blot out Amalek, but in his days, a good deal of the Land remained to be possessed, (See Joshua 13:1.)  and the time for the fulfilling of the commandment did not come until the reign of Saul. (See I Samuel, Chapter 15.) "
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Genesis 39:2:3,"ויהי בבית אדוניו המצרי, he would perform tasks in his master’s private room. The meaning of the word היה here is the same as the meaning of the word עמד elsewhere, i.e. stationed, remaining in a fixed position. Examples of the word היה occurring in this sense are found in Deuteronomy 31,26 והיה שם, “it would remain there.” Compare also Deuteronomy 10,5 ויהיו שם כאשר צוני ה', “they remained there as the Lord had commanded me.”"
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 34:5:1,"וימת שם משה AND MOSES DIED THERE — Is it possible that Moses, died, and then wrote: “And Moses died there”? But, thus far did Moses write, from here and onward Joshua wrote. Rabbi Meir said: But is it possible that the Book of the Torah would be lacking anything at all, and yet it would state before the account of Moses' death was written in it, (Deuteronomy 31:26) “Take this book of the Torah” -? Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, dictated this, and Moses wrote it in tears (Sifrei Devarim 357:28; Bava Batra 15a, Menachot 30a)."
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Minchat Chinukh 613:1:1,"A person does not fulfill the commandment until the Torah is written in ‎accordance with the laws of a Sefer Torah. If there is a disqualification, even a missing or extra ‎letter, then a person does not fulfill this mitzvah, for it is not a Sefer Torah at all. The gemara ‎‎(Menachot 30a) asks, ""Could a Torah be missing a letter? It is written(Devarim 31:26), 'Take this ‎Sefer Torah'!"" The Rambam (Hilchot Tefillin, Mezuzahv'Sefer Torah 7:11) lists disqualifications and ‎says, ""It does not have the status of a Sefer Torah, only as a chumash from which they teach ‎children."" The Ran (Megilah) also writes that a person does not fulfill the mitzvah of writing a sefer ‎Torah with [a Torah that is] missing a letter. According to this, we cannot fulfill the mitzvah, for the ‎gemara (Kiddushin 30)explains that previous generations were expert in which letters to exclude ‎and which to include, but we are not expert. Therefore, we who are not expert might include a ‎letter in a word that should be written without it, or the reverse, and consequently we would not ‎fulfill the mitzvah [of writing a Torah] at all. The Shaagat Aryeh (36) has already suggested that we ‎might be exempt from this mitzvah today because we are not expert in missing and extra letters. ‎We can suggest that we are expert in the four chapters of the tefillin, for if this were not so, then ‎we could not fulfill the mitzvah of tefillin. We must say that since tefillin area constant mitzvah and ‎only include four‏ ‏paragraphs, we did not forget how to write‏ ‏it. As to the entire Torah, we are not ‎expert.‎‏ ‏Nonetheless, this remains difficult; writing a Torah is also a mitzvah, so how could people‏ ‏have failed to set their hearts against‏ ‏forgetting it?... How could the proper writing‏ ‏of the Torah ‎have been forgotten in the days‏ ‏of the Amoraim [recorders of the gemara]?‎‏ ‏In my humble ‎opinion, the explanation is‏ ‏that there are two types of missing or extra‏ ‏letters. One type involves a ‎missing or extra‏ ‏letter which changes the meaning of the‏ ‏word, or has the potential to change the‏ ‏meaning, like the examples cited in the‏ ‏gemara (Sanhedrin 4a)... According to theone who says ‎that we translate based on the‏ ‏word as it is written, a word which has an‏ ‏extra letter or is missing a ‎letter changes the‏ ‏message of G-d, for many laws will be‏ ‏altered from their true status. Even‏ ‏according to the opinion that we translate‏ ‏based on the word as it is pronounced, so‏ ‏that should ‎law does not change [based‏ ‏upon our incorrect writing], the Torah‏ ‏must still be written as it was ‎given. Therefore, when a Torah is missing a‏ ‏letter, since the Torah was given to us to‏ ‏be written ‎thus and not the way the word is pronounced [this change will disqualify ‎‏ ‏the Sefer Torah]… ‎However, other‏ ‏missing or extra letters do not change the‏ ‏meaning of the word…‎‏ ‏Certainly, the ‎first type of letters [i.e. the‏ ‏letters that would change the meaning of a word] were not forgotten… ‎but the‏ ‏missing or extra letters that would not‏ ‏change the meaning or cause harm by their absence ‎or inclusion were not‏ ‏known… and these letters, which do not‏ ‏change anything, do not harm this‏ ‏mitzvah and a person fulfills entirely the‏ ‏mitzvah to write a Torah with this act of writing… G-d ‎forbid that the Jewish‏ ‏people could not fulfill a biblical mitzvah‏ ‏for many generations.‎"
31,26,Quoting Commentary,Rambam Introduction to the Mishnah 2:21,"And when it was before his death, he began to write the Torah in books. And he wrote thirteen books of the Torah – all of them [on] parchment – from [the letter] bet [in] Bereishit (the first word in the Torah) to [the letter] lamed [in] le’einei kol Yisrael (the last phrase in the Torah) (Bava Batra 15a). And he gave a book to each and every tribe, to behave according to it and to walk in its statutes. And the thirteenth book he gave to the Levites, and said to them (Deuteronomy 31:26), ""Take this book of the Torah."""
31,26,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Exodus 17:14:1","כתוב זאת זכרון בספר, “record this in a book for remembrance in the future.” Ibn Ezra writes that the book referred to is the one also known as מלחמות ה', “the Lord’s wars,” a book which has disappeared in the course of time.
    Nachmanides writes that what Ibn Ezra writes here is pure speculation, and that the book referred to is the Torah itself. [he bases himself on the vowel patach under the letter ב in the word בספר, which describes a well known book. Ed.] Compare Deut. 31,26 לקוח את ספר התורה הזה, “to take this Book of the Torah.” G’d commanded Moses to incorporate this historical item in the holy Torah so that the Israelites would forever remember the totally unprovoked attack by Amalek that they had had to endure. This is just another aspect of the commandment at the end of Parshat Ki Tetze, to wipe out the memory of the people of Amalek totally and irreversibly, once the time had come when we were at peace and genocide could not longer be considered an act of revenge motivated by personal motives. (Deut.25,17-19)
    When the Torah here instructs Moses ושים באזני יהושע, “make sure that Joshua hears it well,” this is because the commandment would not become operative until after the Jewish people were settled in their own land, so that Moses, who was not going to take them into that land, would not have a share in performing this commandment. [if not for the sin of the golden calf and that of the spies, carrying out the commandment might not have had to wait until the Jewish people had appointed a king for themselves, well over 300 years after Joshua’s death. Ed.] Seeing that Joshua left much of the land of Canaan unconquered at the time of his death, the commandment in accordance with Deut.25 could not yet have become operative.
"
31,26,Talmud,Gittin 60a:14,"The Gemara returns to discuss the previously mentioned dispute. Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Bana’a: The Torah was given from the outset scroll by scroll, as it is stated: “Then I said, behold, I come with the scroll of the book that is written for me” (Psalms 40:8). King David is saying about himself that there is a section of the Torah, “the scroll of the book,” that alludes to him, i.e., “that is written for me.” This indicates that each portion of the Torah constitutes a separate scroll. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: The Torah was given as a complete book, as it is stated: “Take this scroll of the Torah” (Deuteronomy 31:26), which teaches that from the outset the Torah was given as a complete unit."
31,26,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10:11","A person who was journeying from one place to another with a Torah scroll should not place the Torah scroll in a sack, load it on a donkey, and then ride on [the beast]. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, it is permissible. If there is no danger, he should carry it in his bosom while riding the animal, and journey [onward]. Anyone who sits before a Torah scroll should sit with respect, awe, and fear, because [the Torah] is a faithful testimony [of the covenant between God and the Jews] for all the inhabitants of the earth, as [Deuteronomy 31:26] states: ""And it will be as a testimony for you."" (The proof-text chosen by the Rambam is somewhat difficult. It states that the Torah will be ""testimony for you,"" while previously he spoke of its being ""testimony for all the inhabitants of the earth."" This difficulty can be resolved by interpreting the proof-text, ""It will be testimony about you"" - i.e., the Torah will be testimony to all the inhabitants of the world that an essential bond exists between God and the Jewish people. The awareness that the Torah communicates this concept should naturally, without effort, bring a person to ""sit with respect, awe, and fear"" in the presence of a Torah scroll (Likkutei Sichot, Shavuot 5747).)  A person must honor a Torah scroll [to the full extent] of his potential. The Sages of the early generations (Avot 4:6. Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets this statement slightly differently.)  said: ""Whoever desecrates the Torah will have his person (גופו translated as ""person,"" literally means ""body."" Honoring a Torah scroll, the body of the Torah as it were, will bring honor to one's physical being.)  desecrated by people. Whoever honors the Torah will have his person honored by people."" (The Rambam reverses the order of the Mishnah in order to conclude positively.)  Blessed be God who offers assistance."
31,26,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 27:16,"All of the commandments that were given to Moses from Sinai were given with their interpretation, as it is said, ""And I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law (the Torah) and the commandment"" (Ex. 24:12). ""Torah"" refers to the written Torah ""and the commandment"" refers to the interpretation of the written Torah (Berakoth 5a). And we have been commanded to fulfill the Torah according to the commandment, and this commandment is called the Oral Law. Moses, our teacher, wrote the whole Torah with his own hand, before he died, and he gave a copy to each tribe. And one copy he placed in the Ark, as testimony, as it is said, ""Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the Ark of the covenant of thy Lord your God, that it may be there for witness against thee"" (Deut. 31:26)."
31,26,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 10:1:3","I have already mentioned in connection with Exodus 16,32 that the Ark constructed by Betzalel was secreted inside the Temple (of Solomon) together with the bottle of manna and certain other sacred vessels at the instruction of King Yoshiah who hid them under an area of the Sanctuary known as מחילה. There was a special reason why these specific vessels were selected for hiding rather than others. The reason that King Yoshiah hid the Ark rather than most other sacred vessels was twofold; one reason was its superior holy status unmatched by other sacred vessels. Seeing that it was the first of the holy vessels to be constructed, its holiness was greater than the vessels fashioned later. It was perceived as a symbol of the celestial throne. As a result of such considerations it was feared that loss of the Ark would be equivalent to a departure of G’d’s presence from the land of Israel. The king knew that the state of Israel was going to be destroyed by Nevuchadnezzar as the prophets of his time had been threatening this if the people did not return to G’d wholeheartedly. It was clear to him that the conquerors would capture and take with them the holy vessels of the Temple to Babylon; this is why he was so concerned with the honour of the Holy Ark that he preferred to bury it and hide it.  The second reason was that the Holy Ark symbolized for him the journeys of the Jewish people. He experienced that the staves of the Holy Ark which protruded a long distance beyond either corner to enable it to be carried. [It was very heavy due to the outer and inner layer of solid gold plus the weight of the Stone Tablets. I have seen a calculation of the total weight of the Ark complete with contents in Eliyahu Ki Tov’s commentary on Parshat Terumah or Tetzaveh. If my memory does not deceive me the weight approximated 3 tons. (76,000 lbs) Ed.]   During the reign of King Yoshiah these staves became visibly shorter, making transportation by means of them impossible. They reverted to the size they had been in Moses’ time. The king viewed this as a bad omen. Originally, the staves could be seen protruding through the dividing curtain of the Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies by causing the curtain to protrude into the airspace of the Sanctuary where it was pushed by these staves. The retraction in the length of these staves meant for King Yoshiah that the Ark was once more destined to travel, just as in the days of Moses. The Israelites, when looking into the open doors of the Sanctuary, could no longer perceive the curtain bulge at the point they were used to see it do so.  The king also saw that when the High Priest Chilkiyah came to perform the service in the Sanctuary (Kings II 22,8) that he found a Torah scroll on the side of the Holy Ark which had rolled into the Sanctuary instead of remaining in its assigned place in the Holy of Holies on top of the Ark (compare Deut. 31,26 and Talmud Baba Batra 14). These occurrences meant for him that the Temple would be destroyed. This is the reason why Targum Yonathan renders Ezekiel 1,1 “it was in the thirtieth year” as a reference to the year that Chilkiyah found the Torah scroll we mentioned. When considering these various omens King Yoshiah decided to hide the Holy Ark so that it would not have to travel into captivity.  We have established that the sanctity associated with the Ark applied to the Ark made by Betzalel, not the box made by Moses to accommodate the Tablets when he would come down from the mountain many months before the Tabernacle had been erected. Moses’ “ark” was strictly a temporary housing for the Tablets pending the construction of the Tabernacle. Concerning the Ark constructed by Betzalel, the Talmud in Eiruvin 63 taught that whenever the Ark and therefore the Presence of the Shechinah were not in their assigned abodes the Israelites were forbidden to engage in marital relations with their wives. It is totally impossible to understand this statement of the Talmud as applying to the ark made by Moses, i.e. the ark that went to war with the people. Seeing that the Holy Ark was held in captivity by the Philistines for seven months (Samuel I 6,1), we cannot assume that during all this time the people did not practice the commandment to be fruitful and to multiply. [I do not understand the author here. He had previously accused the sons of Eli of taking Betzalel’s Ark to war without G’d’s authorization although normally only Moses’ ark would be taken to war. Moreover, note that in Samuel I 4, it is clear that it was not Moses’ ark the people took to war on that occasion. Ed.]  David is also reported to tell Uriah (Bat Sheva’s first husband) to go home and engage in marital relations, all of this while war was in progress (Samuel II 11,8). Surely the prohibition mentioned in the Talmud could have applied only to the Ark of Betzalel. The lesson the sages taught must have been “When the HOLY ARK was not ‘at home,’ i.e. G’d was not at home, how could the people feel “at home,” by indulging in marital relations and carry on “business as usual!”"
31,26,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 34:1:1","ויעל משה, “Moses ascended;” according to the view of Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, these words and all those that follow have been written by Moses’ disciple Joshua, seeing that after Moses ascended he did not come back, and when should he have written these words and where? Joshua wrote these lines after having been prophetically inspired, seeing that he was not an eye-witness to what is described in these verses. Ibn Ezra views the words ויראהו ה', “the Lord showed him,” as proof that Moses could not have written this, else he would have written ויראני ה', “the Lord showed me.” He also feels it is impossible for Moses to have written, concerning himself, “he was buried there.” Ibn Ezra felt constrained to adopt this approach as he could not accept that Moses describes his own death and burial while still alive.  However, this is not true; his commentary is not correct. The correct way of viewing these lines is that we must accept the tradition that Moses wrote the entire Torah including the last eight verses at the dictation of G’d. In fact, one may view Moses as someone who copied verbatim a book which had been written long before he ever lived. This is the view of Rabbi Meir in Baba Batra 15 who said: “is it conceivable that the Torah would be complete if even a single letter of it were missing? Was it not Moses himself who commanded the Levites in Deut. 31,26: ‘to take this book of the Torah?’ Did he command them to take an incomplete Torah?” We must adopt the opinion of the sages in the Talmud who hold that Moses wrote these last verses בדמע. [I have never been sure if this means “tearfully,” or “with tears,” i.e. substituting tears for ink. Ed.]  I do not believe that it is something so extraordinary for us to believe that Moses could write a verse saying: “Moses, the servant of Hashem, died there, and He buried him in the valley, etc.,” seeing he was writing matters which had not happened yet but would surely happen in the future. He had previously written about things which had not happened yet but would happen in the future, when he wrote (Deut. 32,19) “the Lord saw and became exasperated and spurned His sons and daughters, etc.” At that time Moses had predicted events which would not occur until the fall of the Temple. He had also described many other events in the future in the past tense, as if they had already taken place. This was a style employed by many prophets and is something we should not have too much trouble to understand (Compare Nachmanides on Exodus 15,1 and the use of the future tense there for an event which had just occurred)."

There is no need for him to be ""ashamed"" at taking such a step.

(Psalms 119:6). The mitzvot given to Moses at Mount Sinai were all given together with their explanations, (By emphasizing that, at the revelation at Sinai, the mitzvot were given ""together with their explanations,"" the Rambam stresses that the Written and Oral Laws cannot be viewed as two separate entities, but rather as two dimensions of a single whole.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."

Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,26,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 31:26:1","V. 26. לקח וגו׳. Wir haben bereits zu V. 10 erwähnt, daß nach דברים רבה Mosche vor seinem Ende außer diesem im Allerheiligsten zu bewahrenden jedem Stamme ein von seiner Hand geschriebenes Exemplar der תורה übergab.

31,26,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:26,"Take this book of the Torah, and place it at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, near the Tablets of the Covenant, and it, the book, will be there as a witness for you."
31,26,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 31:26:1,"לקח את ספר התורה הזה, “take this book of the Torah!” according to a Midrash, on this date, the seventh day of the month of Adar, Moses personally wrote 13 Torah scrolls one each for the twelve tribes. He read out of each one before each of the tribes passages of warning, exhorting them to observe the Torah meticulously. He read to the men and women separately, warning them to treasure their Torah scroll and protect it from all hazards. Moses took the thirteenth Torah scroll and deposited it in the Holy Ark next to the second set of Tablets. This interpretation is based on the text of this verse, which appears portray him as instructing the priests to do so, [as being “only” a Levite he had no access to the Holy Ark inside the tabernacle. Ed.] Other commentators suggest that the archangel Gavriel descended from the heavenly regions and took the thirteenth Torah scroll back with him to those regions. The reason for this was to acquaint the residents of those regions with the greatness of Moses. This exegesis is based on Deuteronomy 33,21: צדקת ה' עשה ומשפט עם ישראל, “He executed the righteousness of the Lord and His ordinances with Israel.” Not only this, but the righteous in those regions read from this Torah scroll every Monday and Thursday, every Sabbath and on every New Moon and the festivals. In the first chapter of the tractate Baba batra, folio 14 there is reported a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehudah, about whether the Torah scroll was deposited inside the Holy Ark or next to it."
31,26,Talmud,Bava Batra 14a:14,"And the chest in which the Philistines sent the gift to the God of Israel was placed alongside the Ark, as it is stated: “And put the golden devices which you are restoring to Him for a guilt-offering in a chest by the side of it, and send it away that it may go” (I Samuel 6:8). And upon this chest lay the Torah scroll, as it is stated: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 31:26). This means that it was placed at the side of the Ark, and not inside it."
31,26,Talmud,Bava Batra 14b:3,"Having concluded its current discussion, the Gemara now addresses the details of the aforementioned baraita and asks: And according to Rabbi Yehuda, who says that the Torah scroll rested on the chest that came from the Philistines, where was the Torah scroll placed before the chest arrived? The Gemara answers: A shelf protruded from the Ark and the Torah scroll rested on it. The Gemara asks: And according to Rabbi Meir, who says that the Torah scroll rested inside the Ark, what does he do with this verse: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the side of the Ark” (Deuteronomy 31:26)? The Gemara answers: He requires that verse to teach that the Torah scroll was placed at the side of the tablets, and that it was not placed between the two tablets, but it was actually placed inside the Ark at the side of the tablets."
31,26,Talmud,Bava Batra 15a:5,"Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible that the Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll” (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. Rather, until this point the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated after Him and wrote the text. From this point forward, with respect to Moses’ death, the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears. The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen later, as it is stated concerning the writing of the Prophets: “And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll” (Jeremiah 36:18)."
31,26,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 4:20,"“The charge of Elazar, son of Aaron the priest, is the illuminating oil, and the incense of the spices, and the meal offering of the daily offering, and the anointing oil: the charge of the entire Tabernacle, and of everything that is in it, in the sacred, and in its vessels” (Numbers 4:16).  “The charge of Elazar, son of Aaron the priest…” – that is what is written: “Do not glorify yourself before a king, and do not stand in the place of the prominent” (Proverbs 25:6). If before a king of flesh and blood a person must conduct himself with humility, all the more so before the Omnipresent. We learned: Be bold like a leopard, nimble like an eagle, run like a deer, and be strong like a lion to perform the will of your Father in heaven, (Mishna Avot 5:20.)  to teach you that there is no haughtiness before the Omnipresent. Eliyahu said: Anyone who increases the glory of Heaven and minimizes his own glory, the glory of Heaven increases and his own glory increases. But anyone who minimizes the glory of Heaven and increases his own glory, the glory of Heaven remains as it was, and his glory is diminished.  There was an incident involving a certain man who was standing in a synagogue and his son was standing opposite him. All the people were responding to the one who passes before the ark: (The prayer leader.)  Halleluya, and his son responded with words of frivolity. They said to him: ‘Look at your son, that he is responding with words of frivolity.’ He said to them: ‘What shall I do? He is a child, let him play.’ Again, the next day he acted in the same manner: All the people were responding to the prayer leader: Halleluya, and his son responded with words of frivolity. They said to him: ‘Look at your son, that he is responding with words of frivolity.’ He said to them: ‘What shall I do? He is a child, let him play.’ All those eight days of the festival, his son would respond with matters of frivolity, and he did not say anything to him. Not one year passed, not two, and not three until that man died, his wife died, his son and grandson died. Fifteen people from his house died, and only one pair of people remained: one crippled and blind, and a wicked imbecile.  Again there was an incident, involving a certain person who regretted that he had not studied Bible or Mishna. One time, he was standing in a synagogue. When the one passing before the ark reached the sanctification of the Name, he raised his voice and said: “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 6:3). They said to him: ‘What did you see that led you to raise your voice.’ He said to them: ‘I have been privileged to study neither Bible nor Mishna; now that I have been given permission, will I not raise my voice and my soul will be calmed?’ Not one year passed, not two, and not three until that man ascended from Babylonia to the Land of Israel. They appointed him commander of the emperor’s army and appointed him as the head of all the fortresses in the Land of Israel. They gave him a site, and he constructed a city and settled there. They called him Kilonai, (A term meaning that he did not have to pay taxes.)  him, his children, and his children’s children throughout all the generations. From here you learn that a person should not comport himself with haughtiness before the Omnipresent, as anyone who is haughty before Him will be debased. Likewise it says: “For those who honor Me I will honor, but those who scorn Me will be debased” (I Samuel 2:30).  Likewise, you find regarding David king of Israel who did not conduct himself haughtily before the Omnipresent, but rather, he debased himself before Him like a commoner, in order to increase the glory of the Omnipresent. When? It was when he took up the Ark from the house of Avinadav in Giva to bring it to Jerusalem. That is what is written: “David again gathered all the chosen of Israel, thirty thousand.” (II Samuel 6:1). David said: I am not taking up the Ark secretly. He immediately consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds to send throughout the Land of Israel that they should gather to them and go to take up the Ark, as it is stated: “David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with every high official” (I Chronicles 13:1). “David said to the entire congregation of Israel: If it pleases you, and if it is from the Lord our God…so that they gather themselves to us; and let us transfer the Ark of our God to us” (I Chronicles 13:2–3). They all said to him: ‘Do as you wish,’ as it is stated: “The entire congregation said to do so, for the matter was upright in the eyes of the entire people” (I Chronicles 13:4). Immediately, he sent and gathered all of Israel that was in the entire Land of Israel, as it is stated: “David assembled all Israel, from Shiḥor of Egypt until Levo Ḥamat, to bring the Ark of God from Kiryat Ye’arim” (I Chronicles 13:5). How many elders did David appoint there? Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar and Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: David appointed ninety thousand elders on that day, but he did not appoint Aḥitofel with them. He sanctified them so they would serve as an honor guard before it. That is what is written: “David again [vayosef od] gathered all the chosen of Israel, thirty thousand.” “Vayosef” – thirty thousand; “od” – thirty thousand; and the plain meaning of the verse, thirty thousand; that is ninety thousand.  Immediately, they went to Giva to take up the Ark from there, as it is stated: “David and all the people who were with him from Baalei Yehuda rose and went [to take up from there the Ark of God]” (II Samuel 6:2). One verse says: “David and all Israel went up to Baala, to Kiryat Ye’arim which is of Judah, to take up from there the Ark of God, the Lord who is seated amidst the cherubs, upon which the Name is called” (I Chronicles 13:6). And one verse says: “David and all the people who were with him from Baalei Yehuda…” How can these two verses coexist? All Israel went to Baala, which is Kiryat Ye’arim, and waited there for the Ark, until they would bring it from Giva. But David and the elders set out from Baalei Yehuda, which is Baala, which is Kiryat Ye’arim, and went after the Ark to Giva to bring it from Giva to Kiryat Ye’arim, which is Baala. From Baala, all of Israel took it with them to Jerusalem.  Some say: Initially they decided they would go only to Baala and send from there to the house of Avinadav, which was in Giva, to take up the Ark of God from there to Kiryat Ye’arim. From there they would all ascend with it to Jerusalem. When he was there, he said to them: ‘It is not in keeping with the honor due the Ark that it should come with individuals. Rather, let us all go there.’ That is why it is written: “David and all the people…rose and went” (II Samuel 6:2).  Why did he initially go only to Baala, which is Kiryat Ye’arim? It is because Giva and Kiryat Ye’arim were located in one area, which is where the Givonites were settled, as it is stated: “The children of Israel traveled, and they came to their cities on the third day. Their cities were Givon, Kefira, Be’erot, and Kiryat Ye’arim” (Joshua 9:17). Kiryat Ye’arim fell into the portion of Judah, as it is enumerated in the portion of its inheritance: “Kiryat Baal, which is Kiryat Ye’arim” (Joshua 15:60), and it was the border between Judah and Benjamin, as it says regarding the border of Benjamin: “Its terminus was at Kiryat Baal, which is Kiryat Ye'arim, a city of the children of Judah…” (Joshua 18:14). But Giva, where the Ark was, was on the border of Benjamin, as it is written regarding the cities of Benjamin: “Givon, Rama, and Be’erot; and Mitzpe, Kefira, and Motza” (Joshua 18:25–26). That is why they initially came to Kiryat Ye’arim, which is on the border between Judah and Benjamin, and then they went to Givon.  “Which is called the Name, the name of the Lord of hosts” (II Samuel 6:2) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It teaches that the Name and all His appellations are placed in the Ark. Rav Huna said: It teaches that the tablets and the shards of the tablets are placed in the Ark.  “They mounted the Ark of God [onto a new wagon]” (II Samuel 6:3) – they did not carry it as it is in the Torah, as it is written: “But to the sons of Kehat he did not give [because the sacred service is upon them, they shall bear on the shoulder]” (Numbers 7:9). Why was he punished to have been rendered oblivious to the verse? It is because he called matters of Torah “songs,” as it is stated: “Your statutes were songs to me…” (Psalms 119:54). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Matters of Torah in whose regard it is written: “If you cast [hata’if] your eyes on it, it is gone” (Proverbs 23:5), (This verse is expounded to mean: If you close your eyes from matters of Torah they will be forgotten. The root ayin-yod-peh in Aramaic means double, so the verse can be understood as: If you double your eyes, meaning cover them with your eyelids.)  you call them songs? I will cause you to fail regarding a matter that even schoolchildren know: “But to the sons of Kehat he did not give…,” and he brings it in a wagon. The Ark lifted the priests (The reference is to the priests who were carrying the Ark to the wagon.)  high and slammed them to the ground, lifted the priests high and slammed them to the ground. David sent and summoned Aḥitofel; he said to him: ‘Will you not say to me what we shall do with this Ark, as it is lifting the priests high and slamming them to the ground, lifting the priests high and slamming them to the ground?’ He said to him: ‘Send and ask those wise men whom you appointed.’ David said: ‘One who knows how to stop it and does not stop it, will ultimately be strangled.’ He said to him: ‘Slaughter offerings before it, and it will stop.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Aḥitofel: ‘A matter that the children say in the synagogue each day: “But to the sons of Kehat he did not give…” you did not say to him, but this great matter you said to him: Slaughter offerings before it, and it will stop?’ That is why he was slaughtering when he took it up the second time, so he would not experience this, as it is stated: “It was, when [the bearers of the Ark of the Lord] walked [six paces, that he would slaughter a bull and a fatling]” (II Samuel 6:13).  Uza and Aḥyo were driving the wagon, as it is stated: “They conveyed it from the house of Avinadav…[Uza and Aḥyo, sons of Avinadav, were driving the new wagon]” (II Samuel 6:3), Uza after it and Aḥyo before it. “They conveyed it from the house of Avinadav that was in Giva, [with the Ark of God, and Aḥyo was walking before the Ark]” (II Samuel 6:4). To what is the verse “They conveyed it from the house of Avinadav” referring? What did they carry with it? It was a chest that the Philistines sent, a gift to the God of Israel, (I Samuel 6:7–12.)  upon which a Torah scroll was placed, like that which we learned: The Ark that Moses crafted: “Its length two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits” (Exodus 25:10) – with a cubit containing six handbreadths. The length of the tablets was six handbreadths, their width six, and their thickness three. They were placed along the length of the Ark. How much did the tablets fill? It was twelve handbreadths. Three handbreadths remained. Deduct from them one handbreadth, half for this wall and half for that wall. Two handbreadths remained in which the Torah scroll was placed, as it is stated: “There was in the Ark nothing [ein] but [rak] the two tablets [of stone]” (I Kings 8:9). Ein rak, an exclusion after an exclusion (One of the rules used to interpret verses in the Torah is that when an exclusion is followed by another exclusion it comes to teach that there is something which has to be included. (Yoma 43a).)  is only to include the Torah scroll that was placed in the Ark. You have accounted for the Ark by its length; come account for the Ark by its width. How much did the tablets fill in the Ark? It was six handbreadths. Deduct from them one handbreadth, half for this wall and half for that wall. Two handbreadths remained so that the Torah scroll would enter and exit without difficulty. This is the statement of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Yehuda says: It is with a cubit containing five handbreadths. The length of the tablets was six handbreadths, their width six, and their thickness three. They were placed along the length of the Ark. How much did the tablets fill in the Ark? It was twelve handbreadths. One half handbreadth remained; one fingerbreadth and one half for this wall and one fingerbreadth and one half for that wall. (A handbreadth is four fingerbreadths if one measures with the thumb, five with the index finger, and six with the pinkie. The midrash here is using the measure of six fingerbreadths to a handbreadth.)  You have accounted for the Ark by its length, come account for the Ark by its width. How much did the tablets fill in the Ark? It was six handbreadths. One handbreadth and one half remained. Deduct from them half one handbreadth, one fingerbreadth and one half for this wall and one fingerbreadth and one half for that wall. One handbreadth remained, in which the pillars stood, as it is stated: “King [Solomon] made himself a palanquin.… He crafted its pillars of silver…” (Song of Songs 3:9–10). (“King Solomon [hamelekh Shelomo] made himself [lo] a palanquin” is expounded as a reference to the Ark of the King, to whom peace belongs [hamelekh shehashalom shelo].)  The chest that the Philistines sent as a gift to the God of Israel was placed at its side, as it is stated: “Place the gold objects that you are returning to Him as a guilt offering in a chest at its side, and send it and it will go” (I Samuel 6:8). Upon it, the Torah scroll was placed, as it is stated: “Take this scroll of the Torah, [and place it at the side of the Ark]” (Deuteronomy 31:26). It was placed at its side and not inside it. (Bava Batra 14a.)   How, then, do I realize: “There was in the Ark nothing [ein] but [rak] the two tablets” (I Kings 8:9)? It is to include the shards of the tablets, which were placed in the Ark, because the whole tablets and the shattered tablets were placed on their sides in the Ark, as they were only three handbreadths thick. Before the chest there was a shelf that protruded from the Ark, on which the Torah scroll was placed. That is what is written: “They conveyed it from the house of Avinadav […with the Ark of God]” (II Samuel 6:4) – this is the chest upon which the Torah scroll was placed and was standing at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.   “Aḥyo was walking before the Ark” (II Samuel 6:4) – from here they said: Aḥyo was walking before it.  When they were taking it up, ninety thousand elders were walking before it, the priests were bearing it, (The priests placed it in the wagon, and the wagon was led by priests. Uza and Aḥyo were apparently priests (Maharzu). )  the Levites were playing instruments, and all Israel were reveling; one who had a palm branch in his hand, one who had a drum or a musical instrument. That is what is written: “David and the entire house of Israel were reveling before the Lord [with all kinds of juniper wood, with harps, with lyres, with drums, with timbrels [uvimenaanim], and with cymbals]” (II Samuel 6:5). This is a reference to a palm branch with which a person waves [menaane’a].  “They came to the threshing floor of Nakhon” (II Samuel 6:6) – “Kidon” (I Chronicles 13:9) is written and “Nakhon” is written. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Initially Kidon (Kidon means spear, an instrument of death, as it caused Uza’s death.)  but ultimately Nakhon. (Nakhon means firmly established, after bringing blessing to the house of Oved Edom.)   “Uza reached out to the Ark of God [and took hold of it]” (II Samuel 6:6) – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: The Ark bears its bearers; itself all the more so, as it is written: “It was when the entire people had finished crossing, the Ark of the Lord and the priests passed before the people” (Joshua 4:11) – the Ark bore its bearers and crossed. “Because the cattle had stumbled” (II Samuel 6:6( – why did they stumble? It was because they were taking it in contravention of the Torah. They should have taken it on the shoulder, but they loaded it onto a wagon and it proceeded on its own.  “The wrath of the Lord was enflamed against Uza, and God smote him there al hashal” (II Samuel 6:7) – what is “al hashal”? Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar: One said: Over matters of unwitting actions, and one said: Because he tended to his needs before it. (Some say that on a previous occasion he relieved himself before the Ark. Others say that his focus was on personal matters rather than on the matter of the Ark.)    “And he died there with the Ark of God” (II Samuel 6:7) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Uza will enter the World to Come, as it is stated: “With the Ark of God”; just as the Ark is in existence in the World to Come, so too, Uza will enter the World to Come.  “David was distressed [vayiḥar] because the Lord had lashed out [in a breach against Uza]” (II Samuel 6:8) – what is vayiḥar? Rabbi Elazar said: It is that David’s face changed and resembled a loaf baked on coals [ḥarara]. (Wrinkled, dry, and black.)  What is the reason? It is because af is not written with it. (Typically the word vayiḥar is followed by the word af (see the previous verse), and together they mean: His wrath was enflamed. Here, vayiḥar is not followed by af. Therefore, the Sages attribute an additional meaning to it.)   Immediately, David feared to bring it to his home, as it is stated: “David feared the Lord on that day, and he said: How can the Ark of the Lord come to me?” (II Samuel 6:9). What did David do? He diverted it to the home of Oved Edom to remain there, as it is stated: “David was unwilling to transfer the Ark of the Lord to him…and David diverted it to the home of Oved Edom the Gitite” (II Samuel 6:10). Oved Edom was a Levite, as it attributes his lineage with the Levites. Oved Edom and his brethren were sixty-two. (See I Chronicles 26:8.)  Why was his name called Oved? It is because he served [avad] before the Lord properly. Edom, because he reddened [shehedim] David’s face. He was fearful of the Ark lest it kill him, and he serves before it, and the Holy One blessed be He blessed him. “The Gitite” – it is because he was from Gat.  When David returned to Jerusalem, Aḥitofel came and said to him: David, should you not have learned from a small verse that the children read: “But to the sons of Kehat he did not give, [because the service of the sacred objects was upon them; they bore them upon their shoulders]” (Numbers 7:9)? The Levites bear the Ark; the priests do not bear the Ark. On a shoulder they bear the Ark, not on a wagon. From where is it derived that this is so? For you find when he took it up the second time, there was neither priest nor wagon there, as it is stated: “Then David said not to bear the Ark of God, other than the Levites” (I Chronicles 15:2). And it is written: “The children of the Levites bore the Ark of God [as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the Lord, on their shoulders with the poles on them]” (I Chronicles 15:15).  “The Ark of the Lord stayed in the house of Oved Edom the Gitite” (II Samuel 6:11) – our Rabbis said: There were two items that were sacred and great, but people believed that they were harsh. So as not to disseminate slander in their regard, it wrote a conspicuous instance of praise and blessing in their regard. These are: Incense and the Ark. Incense, so that a person would not say that the incense is harsh. It was by its means that Nadav and Avihu died; by its means the assembly of Koraḥ were burned; by its means Uziyahu was afflicted with leprosy. That is why the Holy One blessed be He wrote a significant virtue regarding the incense, that Israel was saved by its means, as it is stated: “Aaron took as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, [and behold, the plague had begun among the people; he placed the incense, and atoned for the people. He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was checked]” (Numbers 17:12–13). The Ark, so that a person will not say that the Ark is harsh. It smote the Philistines, it killed the residents of Beit Shemesh, it killed Uza. That is why it wrote a blessing in its regard, as it is stated: “The Ark of the Lord stayed [in the house of Oved Edom the Gitite for three months, and the Lord blessed Oved Edom and his entire household]” (II Samuel 6:11). It is to teach you that incense and the Ark do not kill, but rather sins kill.  With what did the Holy One blessed be He bless the home of Oved Edom? Rabbi Yosei says: With children; that is what is written: “Oved Edom had sons: Shemaya the firstborn…Yoaḥ the third, and Sakhar the fourth, and Netanel.… Peuletai the eighth, [for God had blessed him]” (I Chronicles 26:4–5). They asked before Rabbi Yoḥanan: What is Peuletai? He said to them: It is because he performed a great action [peula] on behalf of the Torah. What great action did he perform? He would kindle a lamp before the Ark, one lamp in the morning and one lamp in the evening.  Rabbi Yosei rendered it words of parting: If for the Ark that did not eat and drink and requires attention only due to the two tablets that were in it, the home of Oved Edom the Gitite was privileged to be blessed on account of it, one who receives Sages and students with food, drink, and made beds, all the more so that the Holy One blessed be He will pay him his reward. They said regarding Oved Edom: He had eight sons and eight daughters-in-law, and each and every one of them would give birth to two in one month. How so? She would be impure for seven, (Seven days.)  pure for seven, and give birth; impure for seven, pure for seven, and give birth. Sixteen for each month; for three months that is forty-eight. The sons of Shemaya were six, as it is written: “To Shemaya his son were born sons.… The sons of Shemaya: Otni…” (I Chronicles 26:6–7); (According to the midrash, these six sons of Shemaya were born before the Ark arrived.)  that is fifty-four. His eight, as it is written: “Oved Edom had sons…” (I Chronicles 26:4–5), that is sixty-two. That is what is written: “All these were of the sons of Oved Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, capable men with strength for the service: sixty-two for Oved Edom.” (I Chronicles 26:8). That is, “for God had blessed him” (I Chronicles 26:5). That is why it is stated: “[The Ark of God remained with the household of Oved Edom, in his house three months,] and the Lord blessed the house of Oved Edom…” (I Chronicles 13:14).  David heard after three months that the Holy One blessed be He had blessed Oved Edom and his household. He gathered the elders of Israel, the leaders, and the leaders of the priests and Levites to take up the Ark with great rejoicing, as it is written: “It was told to King David, saying: The Lord has blessed the house of Oved Edom…[David went and took up the Ark of God from the house of Oved Edom to the City of David with rejoicing]” (II Samuel 6:12). And one verse says: “David, and the elders of Israel, [and the captains of thousands, who were walking to take up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the house of Oved Edom, were joyful]” (I Chronicles 15:25). Who took it up? The Levites took it up. When David saw that the Levites took it up and were not harmed, as Aḥitofel had said to him, he added and slaughtered more offerings before it as Aḥitofel had said initially. That is what is written: “It was as God helped the Levites, [carriers of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams]” (I Chronicles 15:26).   One verse says: “They sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams” (I Chronicles 15:26). And one verse says: “It was when [the bearers of the Ark of the Lord] would walk six paces, he would slaughter a bull and a fatling” (II Samuel 6:13). Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Mana: One said: For each pace a bull and a fatling, and after seven, seven bulls and seven rams. And one said: For each pace seven bulls and seven rams, and at the end a bull and a fatling. The Rabbis say: One verse explains the other: For each seven (It should read six paces (Matnot Kehuna).)  paces, seven bulls and seven rams. (Jerusalem Talmud, Sanhedrin 10:2.)  Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said: For each and every pace, a bull and a fatling; for every six steps seven bulls and seven rams. Rav Ḥisda said to him: If so, you have filled the entire Land of Israel with altars. Rather, Rav Ḥisda said: For every six paces, a bull and a fatling, and for every six sets of six paces, seven bulls and seven rams. (Sota 35b.)   “David was dancing before the Lord with all his might” (II Samuel 6:14) – come and see to what extent David debased himself for the glory of the Holy One blessed be He. David should have been walking before it like a king clad in his royal garments. [He was] not, but rather David donned fine garments in honor of the Ark and reveled before it in any describable manner saying whatever he could say, as it is stated: “David was wrapped in a fine linen robe along with all the Levites who were bearing the Ark…[upon David there was an ephod of linen]” (I Chronicles 15:27).   And it is written: “David was mekharker before the Lord bekhol oz” (II Samuel 6:14) – what is “bekhol oz”? It is with all his might. What is “mekharker”? It is that he was clapping his hands one upon the other and saying: Exalted Lord [kiri ram]. Israel were shouting and sounding the shofars, trumpets, and all musical instruments, as it is stated: “All the house of Israel were taking up the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sounding of the shofar” (II Samuel 6:15). And one verse says: “All Israel were taking up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord [with shouts, and with sound of a shofar, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding with lyres and harps]” (I Chronicles 15:28).  When they arrived in Jerusalem, all the women were peering at David from the rooftops and from the windows and saw him dancing and reveling, but he did not care. That is what is written: “It was, as the Ark of the Lord was entering the City of David [that Mikhal daughter of Saul peered through the window]” (II Samuel 6:16). You see that his wife was peering at him. From where is it derived that the same is true of all the women of Jerusalem? It is as she says: “How honorable today is the king of Israel, who was exposed today before the eyes of the maidservants of his servants” (II Samuel 6:20).   “She saw King David mefazez umkharker…” (II Samuel 6:16) – when she saw him conducting himself like a commoner, he was contemptible in her eyes. What is mefazez umkharker? What would he do? Our Rabbis said: He was wearing refined gold garments similar to pure gold [paz]. He would strike his hands one on another and clap, and he would cry kiri ram. He would mefazez. What is mefazez? The refined gold that was on him would produce a clinking sound. Could it be that David did not do any more than that? No. Rather, he would reverse his cloak and leap before it, as it is written elsewhere: “And saw King David dancing and reveling…” (I Chronicles 15:29). All the women were peering at him from the rooftops and the windows, and he did not care. From where do you learn that David would reverse his cloak and leap? (The midrash returns to this question later.)    It is as you find that once they took it into the City of David, they displayed it in the place that David had prepared for it, and he and Israel offered up burnt offerings before it, as it is written: “They brought the Ark of the Lord, and they displayed it [in its place, within the tent that David had pitched for it]” (II Samuel 6:17). Elsewhere it is written: “They presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God” (I Chronicles 16:1) – after he concluded the offering, he blessed the entire people because they honored the Ark. He gave gifts to them all as an expression of joy for the Ark, and to the women, as it is stated: “David concluded offering up the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, [and he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts]. He distributed to all the people, to the entire multitude of Israel, [both men and women, to each, one loaf of bread, one portion of beef [eshpar], and one raisin cake [ashisha]]” (II Samuel 6:18–19). What is eshpar? It is one-sixth [eḥad mishisha] of a bull [bapar]; ashisha, one-sixth of an ephah. Some say: Ashisha – a cask of wine, just as it says: “And lovers of goblets [ashishei] of grapes” (Hosea 3:1).  After all Israel took their leave from him, he turned to bless his household and to bring them joy, due to the overwhelming celebration of the Ark. Mikhal emerged to meet him and disgraced him for debasing himself before the eyes of the women in honor of the Ark. That is what is written: “David returned to bless his household. [Mikhal daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and she said: How honorable today was the king of Israel, who was exposed today before the eyes of the maidservants of his servants, in the manner that one of the idlers is exposed]” (II Samuel 6:20). She did not enable him to enter into the house, but she went out and verbally lambasted him. “She said: How honorable today was the king of Israel, who was exposed today before the eyes of the maidservants of his servants.” From here you learn that he reversed his cloak and leapt, as she said to him: “Who was exposed today.” She began instigating a quarrel with him, seeking to utterly shame him. She said to him: ‘Have you seen your glory?’ “How honorable today was the king of Israel”? ‘Now you have let it be known that you are king?’ “Who was exposed today” – if only it had been privately, but rather it was “before the eyes of the maidservants of his servants.” These are the women of Israel, whom she characterizes as maidservants. “In the manner that one of the idlers is exposed” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The idlest of the idlers is the dancing jester, as there is no one idler than he is from any mitzva. That is how David was dancing before the Ark.   She said to him: ‘Today the glory of father’s household has been revealed. Come and see what the difference is between you and father’s household. All members of my father’s household were modest and holy.’ They said about the household of Saul that neither heel nor big toe of theirs was ever seen. That is what is written: “He came to the sheep enclosures upon the way, and there was a cave there. Saul came [to relieve himself]” (I Samuel 24:3). What is, “he came to the sheep enclosures [gidrot]”? Rabbi Avin in the name of Rabbi Elazar: He entered a sheep pen, a gate within a gate. “Saul came to relieve himself [lehasekh et raglav]” – he made himself like a booth [sukka], wrapped in flowing robes and sat in the lavatory. He would lower his garment a bit and raise it a bit, lower it a bit and raise it a bit. David said: It is not proper to harm so modest a body. That is what is written that he said to him: “Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and one said to kill you, and I vataḥas on you” (I Samuel 24:10). It is not written here, “I had compassion [vaaḥus] on you,” but rather, “it has compassion [vataḥas] on you” – your modesty caused there to be compassion on you. That is what Mikhal said to him: ‘The members of father’s household were so modest, and you stand and expose your garment like one of the idlers.’  When she finished her words, he said to her: ‘Was I reveling before a king of flesh and blood? Was it not before the King of kings that I was reveling, who chose me over your father and his entire household? Were your father more righteous than I, would God have chosen me and rejected your father’s household?’ That is what is written: “David said to Mikhal: Before the Lord, [who chose me over your father and over his entire household, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel, I will revel before the Lord]” (II Samuel 6:21). He said to her: ‘Your father was king over Israel alone; I am ruler over Israel and Judah.’ That is what is written: “Over the people of the Lord” – this is the tribe of Judah. “Over Israel” – these are the rest of the tribes.   Another matter: He said to her: ‘The members of your father’s household sought their own glory and forsook the glory of Heaven. I do not do so, but rather, I forsake my own glory and seek the glory of Heaven.’ That is what is written: “I would be demeaned even more than this, [and I would be lowly in my eyes; but with the maidservants of whom you spoke, with them, I would be honored]” (II Samuel 6:22). ‘Do not say that I was lowly in the eyes of others and not contemptible in my perception’; the verse states: “And I would be lowly in my eyes.” “But with the maidservants of whom you spoke, with them, I would be honored” – he said to her: ‘Those women whom you characterized as maidservants are not maidservants [amahot], but mothers [imahot]. If only I will have a portion with them in the future.’ That is what is written: “But with the maidservants of whom you spoke” – if only, “with them, I would be honored.”   Because Mikhal said this, she was punished, as it is written thereafter: “Mikhal daughter of Saul did not have a child until the day of her death” (II Samuel 6:23). But is it not written: “Yitre’am, to Egla his wife” (I Chronicles 3:3)? She lowed like a calf [egla] and died. (The reference is to Mikhal and that she died in childbirth.)  That is what is written: “[Mikhal…did not have a child] until the day of her death” – but on the day of her death she had.  There is no person in Israel who debased himself for the mitzvot more than David. That is what is written that he said: “Lord, my heart was not haughty” (Psalms 131:1) – when Samuel anointed me as king; “nor my eyes lofty” (Psalms 131:1) – when I killed Goliath; “and I did not aspire to greatness” (Psalms 131:1) – when they restored me to my kingdom; “or to what is beyond me” (Psalms 131:1) – when I took up the Ark. “Instead I have composed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child on his mother” (Psalms 131:2) – just as this child is not ashamed to be exposed before his mother, so, I have composed myself before You that I was not ashamed to debase myself before You in Your honor. “My soul is like a weaned child” (Psalms 131:2) – like this infant who emerges from his mother’s womb, and he has no haughtiness of spirit to refrain from nursing from his mother’s breasts, so my soul is upon me, as I am not ashamed to study Torah from the insignificant of Israel. Rabbi Ada bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You have rendered yourself like a weaned child; as you live, just as this child has no iniquities, so, you have no iniquities, as it is stated: “The Lord has expunged your sin; you will not die” (II Samuel 12:13).  From here you learn that a person may not comport himself with haughtiness before the Omnipresent, but rather, he should debase himself for His glory. Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi bar Rabbi Shalom said: The actions of the Holy One blessed be He are unlike the actions of flesh and blood. Why? The cook of flesh and blood has fine garments. When he goes out to the marketplace he wears them, but when he stands and cooks, he removes the nice ones and wears tatters and an apron. Moreover, when he sweeps the stove and the oven, he wears lower-quality garments than those. But before the Holy One blessed be He, when the priest sweeps the altar and removes the ashes, he dons excellent garments, as it is stated: “The priest shall don his linen vestments…” (Leviticus 6:3), so that “he shall remove the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3). Why is it so? It is only to inform you that there is no haughtiness before the Omnipresent.  Likewise, you find that Elazar the priest would comport himself with humility before the Omnipresent. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Elazar was the head of heads, the prince of princes, as it is stated: “The prince of the princes of the Levites was Elazar son of Aaron the priest…” (Numbers 3:32). See the authority that he possessed, and you assume that because he was a prominent man he would delegate others to bear the vessels that he was supposed to bear. No; rather, he himself would bear them, as it is stated: “The charge of Elazar son of Aaron the priest [is the illuminating oil, and the incense of the spices, and the meal offering of the daily offering, and the anointing oil]” (Numbers 4:16). How did he bear all these? Our Rabbis said: This is how he bore them: The anointing oil in his right, the incense of the spices in his left, and the meal offering of the daily offering of the morning was suspended from his forearm. Where was the one brought in the afternoon placed? Rabbi Aḥa said that Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: He would suspend a type of small bowl from his belt, because his loins were girded with a belt like a servant before his master. This is to inform you that there is no haughtiness before God. “The charge of the entire Tabernacle, and of all that is in it, in the sacred, and in its vessels” (Numbers 4:16) – as it was he who would give them the Ark, the table, the candelabrum, and the altars and all their utensils, just as it says: “Their commission: The Ark, [the table, the candelabrum, the altars, and the sacred vessels with which they would serve, and the screen, and all its work]. The prince of the princes of the Levites was Elazar…” (Numbers 3:31–32)."

31,27,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:27:1,"הן בעודני חי עמכם, ""Behold even while I am still alive amongst you, etc."" This again reminds us of what the Talmud stated in Berachot 18 that the righteous are called alive even after their bodies have died. When Moses mentions the words: ""here when I am still alive amongst you,"" he did not imply that he would soon die, but that he would live in a different region of the universe, one which could not be described as עמכם, ""amongst you."""
31,27,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 4:2","Among [the 24] are five deeds which cause the paths of Teshuvah to be locked before those who commit them. They are: a) One who separates himself from the community; when they repent, he will not be together with them and he will not merit to share in their merit. b) One who contradicts the words of the Sages; the controversy he provokes will cause him to cut himself off from them and, thus, he will never know the ways of repentance. c) One who scoffs at the mitzvoth; since he considers them as degrading, he will not pursue them or fulfill them. If he does not fulfill mitzvot, how can he merit [to repent]? d) One who demeans his teachers; this will cause them to reject and dismiss him as [Elishah did to] Gechazi. In this period of rejection, he will not find a teacher or guide to show him the path of truth. e) One who hates admonishment; this will not leave him a path for repentance. Admonishment leads to Teshuvah. When a person is informed about his sins and shamed because of them, he will repent. Accordingly, [rebukes are] included in the Torah, [for example]: ”Remember, do not forget, that you provoked [God, your Lord, in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until here,] you have been rebelling....”(Deuteronomy 9:7 . ”[Until this day,] God did not give you a heart to know....” (Deuteronomy 29:3 . ”[Is this the way you repay God,] you ungrateful, unwise nation” (Deuteronomy 2:6 . Similarly, Isaiah rebuked Israel, declaring: “Woe, sinful nation, [people laden with iniquity...]” (Isaiah 1:4 , ”The ox knows its owner, [and the ass, his master's crib. Israel does not know...]” (ibid.: 1:3), I know you are obstinate... (ibid. 48:4). God also commanded him to admonish the transgressors as [ibid. 58:1] states: ""Call out from your throat, do not spare it."" Similarly, all the prophets rebuked Israel until she repented. Therefore, it is proper for each and every congregation in Israel to appoint a great sage of venerable age, with [a reputation of] fear of heaven from his youth, beloved by the community, to admonish the masses and motivate them to Teshuvah. This person who hates admonishment will not come to the preacher's [lecture] or hear his words. Accordingly, he will continue his sinful [paths], which he regards as good."

31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Exodus 10:10:1","Even were I to send. . . Rashi explains as he does because their flocks and cattle were more valuable to Pharaoh than were their children; for note that after the plague of darkness Pharaoh said (v. 24): “Just let your flocks and cattle stay behind. Even your little ones can go with you.” This implies that even though Pharaoh agreed to their children going with them, he still did not want their flocks and cattle to go with them. Accordingly, this is the meaning of the verse. Pharaoh said to them: You asked to send your children, flocks and cattle. May Hashem be with you [to protect you from disaster] if I send you and your children, and surely if I also send the flocks. This is because  אף כי is like  כל שכן (all the more so). And so it is in Parashas Vayelech (Devarim 31:27): “ אף כי (all the more so) after my demise.” (See Kitzur Mitzrachi for other versions of Rashi) "
31,27,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:27:2,"The Torah writes היום, ""today,"" i.e. Moses hinting that the ""amongst you"" he spoke of refers only to the balance of the day on which he was addressing them. The plain meaning of the verse is that the word היום means עד היום, ""until today."""
31,27,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:27:3,"The reason that Moses referred to the people's acts of rebellion in the past tense, i.e. הייתם, was in case they had already repented of their sins at that very hour. We have been taught in Kidushin 49 that if someone betrothes a woman on the understanding that he (the groom) is a totally righteous person, and we are aware that until very shortly prior to that moment he was a thoroughly wicked person, the lady in question has to consider herself as betrothed as we assume the groom had resolved to become a perfect בעל תשובה at the time he asked her to accept the token of her betrothal to him."
31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 21:1:6","A Kabbalistic approach: the whole procedure of “sacrificing” the עגלה ערופה to the attribute of Justice in its most severe manifestation aims at preventing this attribute which is poised to strike the community in whose proximity the murder occurred from causing harm. The reason the neck of the animal was chosen as the point of death is that it represents the “hardest,” most unbending part of the personality. Seeing that at this time G’d, as it were, turns His back (neck) on us, this calf does not have its throat slit as do the animals which are ritually slaughtered. The reason why this whole legislation is described in such detail is that the murder has occurred in Eretz Yisrael, on holy soil. The reason the Torah added the word בקר to the word עגלת בקר (a calf is always a junior בקר) is that this animal symbolises the חיה with the face of an ox in the prophet’s vision in Ezekiel 1,10. Sometimes the חיה described there as on the ”left,” does appear on the right, i.e. represents the attribute of Mercy.  Although the calf must not have been worked, borne a yoke, it may impose such a yoke, burden on others (symbolically speaking).  As to the words והורדו, “they shall bring it (the calf) down” (verse 4), this means that the elders shall drag the calf down to that valley. The words וערפו שם, reminds us of Genesis 49,24 משם רועה אבן ישראל, [if I understand correctly a reference to Joseph dragging down his family to Egypt, Joseph representing the “ox,” בכור שורו. Ed.]. The words את העגלה בנחל, mean that the calf is to be submerged in the waters of the brook of that valley. These waters are called נחלי אל, a reference to the emanations. The reason the Torah refers to the murdered person as חלל, usually understood as an empty space, is that he has been deprived of his souls, thus effectively making him “empty,” חלול.  The word is also related to חולין, something profane, devoid of sanctity. The procedure is designed to eliminate the spirit of impurity outside the town in the field. This is why the Torah emphasizes נופל בשדה, “fallen in the field” (verse 1). The word חלל is an allusion to orbit, i.e. the revolving planets in their orbits; the slain person is perceived as having been on earth before in a different body. This may be the reason the Torah speaks of חלל באדמה instead of חלל בארץ.  This whole procedure was performed by the priests, the Levites, seeing it is their function to settle strife and plague (verse 5). The words ריב and נגע refer to strife both in the terrestrial regions and in the celestial regions. The waters with which the elders wash their hands (verse 6) represent the waters of the attribute חסד which have their origin in a domain above that of the עגלה. The washing of the hands is to ensure that the elders will not be harmed by the attribute of Justice."
31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 32:5:1","דור עקש ופתלתל, “a perverse and twisted generation.” Now Moses addresses his people, calling them by an unflattering description. These words belong together with the words in the next verse הלה' תגמלו זאת, “are you really going to repeat the mistakes of Adam, Kayin and Hevel and act likewise against Hashem?” (The author states that the period sign after the word פתלתל does not present an obstacle to how he reads these two verses). Seeing that Moses had already told the people in 31,29 that he foresaw how they would become corrupt after his death and serve idols after the death of Joshua, he now urgently warns them against pursuing such a path."
31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 3:18:1","ואצו אתכם בעת ההיא, ”I commanded you at that time, etc.” Moses was now speaking to the tribes of Gad and Reuven. Seeing that they were part of the people of Israel, Moses used the pronoun אתכם, “you,” as if his commandment applied to all the tribes. Actually, it would have been less misleading if he had used the pronoun אותם, “them.” (compare Ibn Ezra). We find something similar at the end of the Torah where Moses “officially” addresses the Levites (Deut. 31,25-27) commencing with “Moses comman-ded the Levites ... to take the Torah scroll and to place it at the side of the Ark; “I have known your rebelliousness and stiff neck, etc.” Although Moses is reported as speaking to the Levites, he addresses the whole people. [The Levites most certainly did not have an exclusive on being rebellious, rather the reverse. Ed,] "

31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Moses; A Human Life, 5 ""Moses wrote his own book"" 173","WRITING IN TEARS As for his death, he refers to it only in the context of a melancholy comment on the people’s rebelliousness (Deut. 31:27). He has, it seems, the darkest expectations of their future “after my death.” The meaning of his death, then, is limited, in his account, to its presumed effect on their future history. But, for obvious reasons, he cannot include the experience of his own death in his final narrative."
31,27,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Vaetchanan 5:5","The prayer of Moshe our teacher peace be upon him to enter the land and was not answered positively. It seems that it was to elevate all the prayers of the Children of Israel that weren't able [the prayers] to go up. All those ineffective prayers had a fixing needed, and this happened through this prayer. And it was all with a certain measure, since Moshe our teacher peace be upon him sacrificed his life for the Children of Israel and even this request of going up to the Land of Israel was also only for the goodness of the Children of Israel. Because he knew that if those prayers did not make it in, the Children of Israel would destroy their own ways, as it is written ""if while I am still living etc"" (Deut. 31:27). Therefore, this prayer was helpful to the Children of Israel, even if his request was not responded positively, the prayer was not for nothing, God forbid."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,27,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:27,"Moses addresses the people: For I know your defiance, and your stiff neck; behold, although all of you know and fear me, nevertheless, while I am still alive with you today, you have been defiant with the Lord, as you are not fully obedient to the word of God, and so too, all the more so after my death. You already show a tendency to defy the will of God. Certainly in more comfortable times you will be unable to resist the greatest temptation that the people of Israel will face throughout its generations, of the quest for normalcy, which in effect results in the abandonment of God. It is therefore best for you to prepare yourselves beforehand for different times."
31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Judaism's Life Changing Ideas; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Devarim; The Effective Critic 10","I believe the answer is this. Throughout Deuteronomy Moses is relentless in his criticism of the people: “From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the Lord…. You have been rebellious against the Lord ever since I have known you.” (Deut. 9:7, 24). His critique extends to the future: “If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!” (Deut. 31:27). Even the curses in Deuteronomy, delivered by Moses himself, (According to the Talmud, Megilla 31b, Moses delivered the curses in Leviticus but the words themselves came from God; the curses in Deuteronomy were formulated by Moses himself. Obviously, the fact that they are in the Torah means that God ratified them.)  are bleaker than those in Leviticus 26 and lack any note of consolation."
31,27,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:10,"Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Ten “deaths” are written in Moses’s regard, and these are: “Behold, your time to die is approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14); “die on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 32:50); “for I will die ” (Deuteronomy 4:22); “for I know, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:29); “and so, too, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:27); “before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1); “one hundred and tweny years old upon his death” (Deuteronomy 34:7); “Moses, the servant of God, died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5); “it was after Moses’s death” (Joshua 1:1); “Moses My servant died” (Joshua 1:2). It teaches that as many as ten times it was decreed against him that he would not enter the Land of Israel, but his harsh sentence was not sealed until the High Court (The supernal High Court.)  revealed itself to him. He [God] said to him: ‘It is a decree from before Me that you will not cross,’ as it is stated: “For you will not cross the Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27). This matter was not consequential in Moses’s eyes, as he said: ‘Israel performed great sins several times, and when I asked for mercy, He immediately accepted it from Me, as it is stated: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). What is written there? “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14). “I will smite them with the pestilence, and I will destroy them” (Numbers 14:12). What is written there? “The Lord said: “I have pardoned…” (Numbers 14:20); I, who have not sinned since my youth, all the more so that when I pray for myself, He will accept it from me.’   When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the matter was inconsequential in Moses’s eyes, and that he was not standing in prayer, He immediately seized the opportunity and took an oath in His great Name that he [Moses] would not enter the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “Therefore [lakhen], you will not bring this assembly [into the land that I have given them]” (Numbers 20:12), and lakhen is nothing other than an oath, as it is stated: “Therefore, I have taken an oath to the house of Eli” (I Samuel 3:14).  When Moses saw that his sentence had been sealed, he decreed a fast upon himself, drew a small circle, stood within it, and said: ‘I am not moving from here until You void this decree.’ At that moment, what did Moses do? He donned sackcloth, wrapped himself in sackcloth, covered himself with ashes, and stood in prayer and supplication before the Holy One blessed be He, until the heavens, the earth, and the order of Creation shook violently, and they said: ‘Perhaps, the desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has arrived.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has not arrived. Rather: “In whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man”’ (Job 12:10), and man is no one other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses was very humble, more than any person on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3). What did the Holy One blessed be He do at that moment? He proclaimed at each and every gate of each and every firmament and each and every court that they should not accept Moses’ prayer and they should not take it up before Him, because the decree had been sealed in his regard. The angel who is appointed over proclamation, his name is Akazriel. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called in a frenzy, and said to the ministering angels: ‘Descend in a frenzy and lock the gates of each and every firmament,’ as the voice of the prayer was forcing its way upward to the firmament due to the sound of Moses’s prayer, as his prayer was like a sword that rips and cuts and cannot be delayed. His prayer was like the ineffable Name that he learned from Zagzael, the master scribe of the residents of the upper world.  Regarding that moment it says: “A wind lifted me, and I heard behind me the sound of a great noise [raash]: Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12). Raash is nothing other than quaking, and great is nothing other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses, too, was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people” (Exodus 11:3). What is “blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place”? When the wheels of the divine chariot and the seraphs of fire saw that the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Do not accept Moses’s prayer,’ and He did not show him favor, did not grant him life, and did not allow him to enter the Land of Israel, they said: “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place,” as there is no favoritism, neither for the small nor the great.  From where is it derived that Mosed prayed during that period five hundred and fifteen times? It is as it is stated: “I pleaded [vaetḥanan] with the Lord at that time, saying” (Deuteronomy 3:23) – that is the numerical value of vaetḥanan. (Vav – 6, alef – 1, tav – 400, ḥet – 8, nun – 50, nun sofit – 50.)  At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is revealed and known before You, my exertion, and the suffering that I underwent for Israel, until they would believe in Your Name. How much suffering I underwent for them regarding the mitzvot, until I bolstered the Torah and the mitzvot in them? I said: Just as I saw their trouble, so, I will see their well-being, but now, when the well-being of Israel has arrived, You say to me: “You will not cross this Jordan”? You are rendering Your Torah a forgery, as it is written: “On his day you shall give his wage, and the sun shall not set upon it as he is poor, and he anticipates it, lest he cry out against you to the Lord and it will be a sin in you” (Deuteronomy 24:15). Is this payment for the work of forty years that I toiled, until they would become a sacred and loyal people? As it is stated: “But Judah still ruled with God, and he is faithful to the Holy One” (Hosea 12:1).  The wicked angel Samael was the head of all the accusing angels. Each moment, he would count toward Moses’s death and say: ‘When will the end arrive, the moment when Moses will die, so I can descend and take his soul from him?’ In his regard, David said: “The wicked man looks upon the righteous man and seeks to kill him” (Psalms 37:32). You have none among the accusing angels as wicked as Samael, and you have none among the prophets as righteous as Moses, as it is stated: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). To what is the matter comparable? It is to a person who happened upon the feast of a bride and groom, and that person was anticipating and saying: ‘When will their rejoicing arrive and I will rejoice in it?’  So, the wicked Samael was anticipating Moses’s soul, and saying: ‘When will Mikhael (Mikhael is the ministering angel of Israel. See Daniel 12:1, Yoma 77a.)  weep and I will fill my mouth with laughter?’ Until Mikhael said to him: ‘What, wicked one, will I weep and you laugh? “Do not rejoice, my enemy, over me; though I fell, I will rise; though I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me”’ (Micah 7:8). “Though I fell” – due to Moses’ passing, “I will rise” – due to Joshua’s leadership, when he toppled the thirty-one kings. (See Joshua 12:7–24.)  “Though I sit in darkness” – with the destruction of the first and latter Temple, “the Lord is a light for me” – in the messianic era.’  Up to this point, one hour had passed. At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me in this world, and I will live and not die.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘If I do not kill you in this world, how will I revive you in the World to Come? Moreover, you will render My Torah a forgery, as it is written in My Torah by your hand: “There is no deliverer from My hand”’ (Deuteronomy 32:39).  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me like the beasts of the field, who eat greenery, drink water, live, and see the world. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you, [do not continue to speak to Me of this matter]” (Deuteronomy 3:26). He said before him: ‘Master of the universe, if not, leave me in this world, like this bird that flies in all directions of the world, and gathers its sustenance each day, and in the evening it returns to its nest. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you.” What is “enough for you”? He said to him: ‘It is enough for you what you have spoken.’ When Moses saw that no creature could save him from the path of death, at that moment, he said: “The Rock, His actions are perfect, as all His ways are justice; a faithful God and there is no injustice, righteous and upright is He” (Deuteronomy 32:4).  What did Moses do? He took the scroll and wrote on it the ineffable Name and the book of the song. (The song of Haazinu (Deuteronomy 32).)  But he did not yet complete it until the moment arrived for Moses to die. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said to Gavriel: ‘Gavriel, go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, one who is the equivalent of sixty myriads, how can I see his death? And one who possesses these qualities, how can I act toward him with fury?’ Then He said to Mikhael: ‘Go out and bring Moses soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I was his teacher, and he was my disciple, and I am not able to see his death.’ Then He said to the wicked Samael: ‘Go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ Immediately, he clothed himself in anger and girded himself with a sword, wrapped himself in cruelty, and went toward Moses. When he saw him that he was sitting and writing the ineffable Name, [that] the aura of his appearance was like the sun, and [that] he resembled an angel of the Lord of hosts, Samael grew fearful of Moses. He said: ‘The angels can certainly not take Moses’ soul.’ Before Samael showed himself to Moses, Moses knew that Samael had come. When Samael saw Moses, a fearful trembling seized him, like the pangs of a woman giving birth, and he was unable to open his mouth to speak to Moses, until Moses said to Samael: ‘“There is no peace, said the Lord, for the wicked” (Isaiah 48:22); what are you doing here?’ He said to him: ‘I came to take your soul.’ He said to him: ‘Who sent you?’ He said to him: ‘The One who created all the creations.’ He said to him: ‘You will not take my soul.’ He said to him: ‘Anyone who comes into the world, their souls are given to me.’ He said to him: ‘'I have greater strength than anyone [else] who comes into the world.’   He said to him: ‘What is your strength?’ He said to him: ‘I am the son of Amram, I emerged circumcised from my mother’s womb, and there was no need to circumcise me. On the day that I was born, I was able to speak, I walked on my feet, I spoke with my father and my mother, and I did not even suck milk. When I was three months old, I prophesied and said that I was destined to receive the Torah from fiery flames. When I was walking outside, I entered the king’s palace and took the crown from upon his head. When I was eighty years old, I performed signs and wonders in Egypt: I took out sixty myriads before the eyes of all Egypt; I split the sea into twelve sections; I sweetened the water of Mara; I ascended and trod a path in the heavens; I engaged in the battle of the angels; I received a Torah of fire; I resided under a throne of fire; took shelter under a pillar of fire; I spoke with Him face to face; I prevailed over the heavenly entourage; I revealed their secrets to humankind; I received Torah from the right [hand] of the Holy One blessed be He, and taught it to Israel. I waged war with Siḥon and with Og, two mighty idol worshippers, who during the Flood, the water did not reach their ankles due to their height. I caused the sun and the moon to stand still in the heights, and I struck them with the staff in my hand and I killed them. Who is there among those who come into the world who can do that? Go from here, wicked one, you must not say that. (That you came to take my soul.)  Go, flee from before me, I will not give my soul to you.’  Immediately, Samael returned and brought the response before the Almighty. The Holy One blessed be He said to Samael: 'Come and bring Moses’ soul.' He immediately drew his sword from his scabbard and stood over Moses. Moses immediately became furious at him, took in his hand his staff, on which the ineffable Name was inscribed, and smote Samael with all his strength, until he fled from before him. He pursued him with the ineffable Name, and removed the beam of glory from between his eyes and blinded his eyes. Until this point, Moses was successful. A moment later, a Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The end, your death, has arrived.’  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, remember that day that You revealed Yourself to me at the bush, and said to me: “And now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and take My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt”? (Exodus 3:10). Remember that day that I was standing upon Mount Sinai for forty days and forty night? I ask You, please, do not hand me over to the angel of death.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: ‘Fear not, I, Myself, will tend to you and to your burial.’ At that moment, Moses stood and sanctified himself, like the seraphs.   The Holy One blessed be He descended from the uppermost heavens of heavens to take Moses’ soul, and there were three ministering angels with him: Mikhael, Gavriel, and Zagzagel: Mikhael prepared Moses’ bier, Gavriel spread a fine linen cloth at his head, and Zagzagel at his feet. Mikhael on one side and Gavriel on one side. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Cover your eyes with your eyelids’ and he covered his eyes with his eyelids. He said to him: ‘Place your hands on your chest,’ and he placed his hands on his chest. He said to him: ‘Place your feet one next to the other.’ He placed his feet one next to the other.   At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He summoned the soul from within his body. He said to it: ‘My daughter, one hundred and twenty years I allotted for your being in Moses’ body. Now, your end has arrived, it is time to leave. Depart, do not delay.’ It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I know that You are the God of all the spirits and all the souls. The soul of the living and the dead  are given into Your hand. You created me, You formed me, and you placed me in Moses’ body for one hundred and twenty years. Now, is there a body in the world purer than Moses’s body? As no putrid wind was ever seen in him, and no worms or maggots. That is why I love it and do not wish to depart from it.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Soul, depart, do not delay, and I will take you up to the uppermost heavens of heavens, I will seat you beneath My Throne of Glory with the cherubs, the seraphs, and the troops.’ (Troops of angels.)    It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from near your Divine Presence on High, two angels, Uza and Azael, descended and lusted after earthly women and corrupted their way on the earth until you suspended them between the earth and the heavens. But the son of Amram, from the day that You revealed Yourself to him, he did not consort with his wife, as it is stated: “Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses with regard to the Kushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Kushite woman” (The midrash here is based on the interpretation that they were talking about the fact that Moses abstained from being with his wife. See Rashi on Numbers 12:1.)  (Numbers 12:1). I ask You please: Leave me in Moses’ body.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He kissed him, and took his soul with a kiss on the mouth.   The Holy One blessed be He began weeping: “Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against the evildoers?” (Psalms 94:16). And the Divine Presence says: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10). The heavens weep and say: “The pious one is lost from the land” (Micah 7:2). The earth weeps and says: “The upright among men is no more” (Micah 7:2). When Joshua sought his master but did not find him, he was weeping and saying: “Help, Lord, for the faithful man is no more, for trustworthiness has disappeared from among men” (Psalms 12:2). The ministering angels say: “He executed the righteousness of God” (Deuteronomy 33:21), and Israel said: “And His ordinances with Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:21). These and those were saying: “May he come in peace, may they rest on their resting places, one who walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2).   “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7), and his soul for life in the World to Come. Amen, so, may it be His will. “Blessed be the Lord forever, amen and amen” (Psalms 89:53)."
31,27,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 27:2,"For twenty-eight days, he was groaning and crying out to the mountain (Isaiah 22:5). It is also said, ""In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon"" (2 Kings 25:8). Elsewhere it says, ""On the tenth day of the month"" (Jeremiah 52:12). It also says, ""In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar"" (Jeremiah 52:29). What does it mean by nineteen? And what does it mean by eighteen? Nineteen refers to the reign, and eighteen to the capture of Jehoiakim. What does it mean by the seventh day of the month? And what does it mean by the tenth day of the month? If we say on the tenth, why also say on the seventh? From now on, know that on the seventh, the nations entered the temple and took the sea, the bronze vessels, and the pillars. They were groaning on the seventh, eighth, and ninth until the day turned (Lamentations 1:14). At dusk, they lit a fire in it, and it was burned on the tenth of the month. Of that generation, it is said, ""For I know his inclination"" (Deuteronomy 31:21), and it is said, ""For I know your rebellion"" (Deuteronomy 31:27), for I knew that after my death, you would corrupt yourselves (Deuteronomy 31:29)."

31,27,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, V'Zot HaBerachah, To Live Is to Serve 7","Korah challenged Moses’ leadership. His own brother and sister spoke negatively about him. He himself, for a momentary lapse in striking the rock, was forbidden to enter the Promised Land, and all his prayers to have the decree lifted were refused. His own sons failed to follow in his footsteps; neither became his successor. He was devastated at how little his impact was on the people. Despite all they had experienced, they did not change. Nor did he hold out any great hope for the future. As he told the next generation, “I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are!

Indeed they were hidden away even during his (Moses) lifetime — on the day of his death, thus fulfilling the words of the text, (Ecclesiastes 8:8) “There is no authority on the day of death” (cf.

31,28,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Beha'alotcha 10:1","(Numb. 10:2 translated literally:) “Make for yourself (lekha),” [i.e.,] at your own expense (literally: from what belongs to you [lekha]). (Numb. R. 15:16.)  (Ibid.:) “Make for yourself.” For yourself you shall make [them] and not for others. You are to use them, and no one else is to use them. You yourself know that in the case of his disciple Joshua, he did not use those [trumpets] but horns (shofars). When they came to fight against Jericho, there gathered in Jericho seven peoples. It is so stated (in Josh. 14:11), “When you crossed the Jordan and came unto Jericho, the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, [the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites,] the Hivites, and the Jebusites fought against you."" Did seven peoples make up the citizens of Jericho, in that it says [here], “the citizens of Jericho: the Amorites….” R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Jericho was the door bolt [for unlocking] the land of Israel. They said, ‘If Jericho is conquered, the whole land will be conquered immediately.’ For that reason seven peoples gathered within it.” What is written (in Josh. 6:20)? “So the people shouted when [the priests] blew on the horns.” [This] teaches that even though Joshua was [Moses'] disciple, he did not use them (i.e. the silver trumpets). Moreover you should not say [this only] about Joshua but even [about] our master Moses, [in that the trumpets] were hidden while he was [still] alive. R. Isaac said, “Note that when Moses was going to depart this world, he said (in Deut. 31:28), ‘Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes [and your officials].’ But where were the trumpets? After all, he did not say, ‘Blow on them for [those people] to gather.’ It is simply that [it was already] while he was [still] alive that they were hidden.” R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “It was to fulfill what was said (in Eccl. 8:8), ‘nor is there control on the day of death….’” Ergo (in Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself....” Make it for yourself, but you shall not use them all the days of your life. Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself.” You are to use them because you are a king, but another is not to use them except King David, as stated (in II Chron. 29:26, 28), “And the Levites stood… the song was sung and the trumpets were blown.” (Numb. R. 15:16.)  Our masters have said, “The trumpets that were in the sanctuary were also hidden, but King David used the harp, as stated (in Ps. 57:9), ‘Awake, my glory; awake, O lyre and harp.’” R. Shimon Hassida said, “A harp was hanging above David's bed. (yBer. 1:1 (2d); Ber. 3:b; PRK 7:4; PR 17:3; M. Pss. 22:8; Ruth R. 6:1; Lam. R. 2:19 (22).)  When midnight arrived, a north wind would blow strongly on it, and it would play of its own accord. Immediately David and the students would arise to occupy themselves with the Torah; and driving sleep from their eyes, they would meditate on the Torah until the dawn arose. Therefore, David said (ibid.), ‘Awake, my glory.’ It is customary for the dawn to awaken the people, but (ibid. cont.) ‘I will awaken the dawn.’” Another interpretation (of Ps. 57:9), “Awake my, glory.” What is the meaning of “my glory?” [My glory is] due to the glory of my Creator. For the [evil] drive would say to him, “David, are you not a king? It is customary for kings to arise at three hours into the day; so why are you arising at midnight?” Then [David] said to it, “Empty is my glory. My glory is nothing before the glory of my Creator.” It is therefore stated, “Awake my glory (words which can also be rendered: empty is ['urah] my glory.” (The form ‘urah can be either a simple imperative (AWAKE) from the root ‘WR or a past intensive passive (WAS EMPTY) from the root ‘RH.)  (Ps. 119:62:) “At midnight I will arise to praise You.” David said, “It is my duty to arise at midnight and to praise You for the wonders that You have done with my ancestor (Ruth) at midnight.” It is so stated (in Ruth 3:8–9), “Now it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled, [so he turned aside, and here was a woman lying at his feet]. Then he said, ‘Who are you?’ And she said, ‘I am your handmaid Ruth.’” R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “She said to him, ‘Are you sending me away with [mere] words?’ He said to her (Ruth 3:13) ‘”As the Lord lives,” I am not sending you away with [mere] words.’” (Ruth 3:13:) “As the Lord lives.” [This oath] teaches that he had imposed an oath on his [evil] drive, which was inciting him by saying to him, “You are an unmarried man and she is an unmarried woman. Now is the time to seduce her.” Immediately this righteous man swore, “As the Lord lives, I am not touching her tonight.” And not only Boaz, but all the righteous impose an oath on their [evil] drive. Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? “And David said, ‘As the Lord lives, the Lord shall smite him; either he will die when his day comes or he will go down and perish in battle; [the Lord forbid that I lay my hand on the Lord's anointed].’” Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “His [evil] drive came and said to him, ‘If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. [Moreover] according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him, since here he is pursuing [you].’ He therefore hastened to swear two times, ‘As the Lord lives, I will not kill him.’” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the universe, You know the power of the evil drive, how strong it is.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Remove it little by little in this world, and I will take it away from you in the future.” Thus it is stated (in Is. 62:10), “build up, complete the highway (The biblical text renders, BUILD UP, BUILD UP THE HIGHWAY.)  [take away some stone] (i.e. the evil drive)!” It also says (in Is. 57:14), “Build up, build up; clear out a way; remove an obstacle (i.e. the evil drive) from the way of my people!” Then in the world to come I will root it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26), “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh.” Thus has R. Tanhuma bar Abba interpreted."
31,28,Midrash,Kohelet Rabbah 8:8:1,"“There is no man who rules the spirit to retain the spirit, and there is no rule over the day of death. There is no release in war, and wickedness will not rescue its owner” (Ecclesiastes 8:8). “There is no man who rules the spirit.” The Rabbis say: “There is no man who rules the spirit” of the angel of death, to prevent him from taking him. From where is it derived that angels are called spirits? As it is stated: “He makes his angels spirits” (Psalms 104:4). “And there is no rule over the day of death,” a person cannot say to the angel of death: ‘Wait for me until I make my accounting, and then I will come.’ “There is no release in war,” a person cannot say: ‘My son, my servant, or a member of my household will take my place.’ “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” – one cannot commute his sentence and one cannot appeal his conviction. Rabbi Neḥemya said: “There is no man who rules the spirit” – there is no prophet of Israel who controls the spirit of the Holy One blessed be He, to prevent Him from [conveying prophesy through] him, as it is stated: “I would say: I will not mention Him, [and I will not speak anymore in His name, but in my heart it would be as a burning fire]” (Jeremiah 20:9). “And there is no rule over the day of death,” [as it is written:] “Those who are to death, to death…” (Jeremiah 15:2). (The prophet cannot refrain from conveying his prophecy even if it is a prophecy of death and destruction.)  “There is no release in war,” [as it is written:] “Send them from My presence and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). “And wickedness will not rescue its owner.” Rabbi Ḥagai in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The cynics of that generation were muttering with their mouths, pointing with their fingers, and were saying: “The vision that he is foretelling [is for many days to come]” (Ezekiel 12:27). The prophet said to them: “For it is in your days, defiant house” (Ezekiel 12:25). Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: There is no man who rules the spirit of the kingdoms, to prevent their [rule] over him. “And there is no rule over the day of death,” as it is stated: “Snares of death confronted me” (Psalms 18:6). “There is no release [mishlaḥat] in war,” as it is written: “A band [mishlaḥat] of destroying animals” (Psalms 78:49). (One cannot escape the retribution of God by waging war against those He sends against Israel (Midrash HaMevoar).)  “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” – but had they repented, they would have mitigated it. (Attempting to emulate the wicked nations will not spare them; repentance will.)  The Rabbis say: There is no man who rules his own spirit to bring about its termination from him. Rabbi Ḥanina said: It is written: “And fashions [veyotzer] the spirit of man within him” (Zechariah 12:1) – [God] bound [tzar] the spirit of man within him, as were it not so, when trouble would come, he would take it and cast it from within him. Rabbi Levi said: Approximately fifty-two times “King David” is written; when he was close to death, it is written: “The days of David drew near to die” (I Kings 2:1) because “there is no rule over the day of death.” Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: The two trumpets that were [used] in the days of Moses were interred. One verse says: “They shall sound them…and they shall congregate to you” (Numbers 10:3), and one verse says: “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribe” (Deuteronomy 31:28); where were the trumpets? (Moses asked the Levites to assemble the people for him instead of blowing the trumpets himself and thereby calling them to assembly.)  Say that they had already been interred in the days of Moses. The Holy One blessed be He said: Why should it be that he will die and his sons will be sounding the trumpets? (As a sign of honor for him upon his death, as is done for kings.)  No, because “there is no rule over the day of death.” Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Simon: The Holy One blessed be He accorded great honor to Moses, as He said to him: “Craft for you two trumpets” (Numbers 10:2), but not for Joshua. (The phrase “for you” is understood to mean that the trumpets were to be used only by Moses.) "

31,28,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 31:18:5","שני לוחות העדות, “the two Tablets of Testimony.” It was a testimony for the Jewish people that the Shechinah resided amongst them, (Pessikta Zutrata). Receiving the Tablets was similar to being handed the seal of the King as proof of the validity of his document.  According to the plain meaning of the text: Why did there have to be two Tablets? Testimony is not valid unless given by two people. Besides, (second Tablets) the material, (stone) was from earth whereas the writing was by the hand of G’d, i.e. originated in heaven. There had to be two Tablets as a reminder of this combination of contributors. We have a verse illustrating this concept in Deut. 31,28 ""I will call as witnesses against them heaven and earth.”"
31,28,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 10:2:2","A Midrashic approach based on Tanchuma Behaalotcha 9-10: [In order to understand this one must remember that the word חצוצרות is related to חצץ which also means crushing stones into pebbles. Ed.] According to this Midrash there is a connection with Psalms 24,7 where Solomon prayed for the gates of the Temple to raise themselves, seeing they were too low to admit the Holy Ark. When the gates demanded to know who was going to enter that they had to change their posture, Solomon said that “the king of glory wants to come in.” This did not satisfy the gates and they demanded again who this king of glory was. Solomon replied that it was ה' עזוז וגבור ה' גבור מלחמה, “the Lord, mighty and valiant, the Lord valiant in battle.” This still did not prove enough to persuade the gates to raise their heads until Solomon added that the king of glory he spoke about was ה' צבאות הוא מלך הכבוד סלה, that it was “the Lord G’d of hosts, He is the king of glory, Selah.” Up until that moment the gates had threatened to crush Solomon. When they heard the latter description of G’d, they opened up immediately. Seeing these gates had shown this honor to G‘d, G’d in turn promised to reward them saying that if and when He allowed His Temple to be destroyed these gates would not fall into the hands of the enemy or into the hands of any other creature.  You should know that when the Babylonians took King Yehoyakim into captivity together with most of the furnishings of the Temple (Daniel 1,2), the gates were hidden. This is the meaning of Lamentations 2,9: “its gates sunk into earth.”  The reason G’d is referred to as the king of כבוד, “glory,” is because He shares some of His glory with His creatures. How do we observe this in practice? We know that G’d is called אלו-הים. We find that G’d accorded the title Elohim to Moses when He told him: “here I have made you Elohim for Pharaoh” (Exodus 7,1). We know that it is G’d’s prerogative to kill and bring to life. Yet we find in Kings I 17,23 when Elijah told the mother: “here your son is alive (again)” that G’d had transferred this power to revive the dead to the prophet Elijah. G’d is known as “king” as we know from Psalms 47,6-8 עלה אלו-הים בתרועה....כי מלך כל הארץ אלו-הים, “G’d ascends as part of the teruah; ....for the king is king over the whole earth.” Moses has also been accorded the title “king,” as we know from Deut. 33,5 ויהי בישורון מלך, “he was king in Yeshurun (the Jewish people). Just as people herald the impending arrival of a king by blowing trumpets so G’d told Moses to make for himself two silver trumpets that were to be blown at the time the Israelites would be assembled (compare verse 3).   The words עשה לך, “make for yourself,” mean that they will be yours exclusively; you will make them and no one else is to use them. Even Moses’ successor and foremost disciple, Joshua, never used the trumpets to blow in but only ram’s horns, such as when he was about to capture the city of Jericho (Compare Joshua 6,3). In fact we have reason to believe that Moses hid these trumpets already during his lifetime as we read in Deut. 31,28: that Moses commanded the Levites to assemble the people to him so he could address them. If the trumpets had ben available at the time, why did he not sound the trumpets to assemble the people? Obviously, they had already been hidden in order to fulfill the statement in Kohelet 8,8 that there is no authority exercised by a ruler on the day he dies. [Deut. 31,28 quotes happenings on the last day of Moses’ life. Ed.]  We find a verse in Chronicles II 29,26 discussing matters which took place in the Temple during the time of King Chiskiyahu. ”The Levites stood equipped with the musical instruments of King David and the Priests were (blowing) the trumpets.” In verse 28 of the same chapter we read והשיר משורר והחצוצרות מחצצרים, “and the song was sung and the trumpets were blown, etc.” This was in contrast to David personally who favoured playing the harp as we know from Psalms 57,9 “awake, O my soul (my glory), awake, O harp and lyre, I will wake the dawn.” We are told that he had a harp hanging over his bed and that as soon as midnight arrived and the North wind began to blow the harp would start playing on its own. As soon as this occurred David would rise from his bed and together with all the other students they would study Torah and chase the sleep from their eyes until dawn.   According to the Tanchuma the reason the verse in Psalms speaks about “waking dawn” in connection with his soul awakening was to demonstrate that David’s personal כבוד was nothing compared to G’d’s כבוד, glory. David “woke” dawn not just for himself but he wanted to shake up people from their slumber.  A more kabbalistic approach: the two trumpets symbolized the tekiah and teruah, i.e. the attribute of Mercy and the attribute of Justice. When G’d said to Moses “these shall be for you an instrument to call the congregation to journey,” this is equivalent to His saying to Moses: “they shall be for you as either tekiah or teruah.” If so, this is clear proof that the journeys and campings of the Israelites were subject to the two attributes mentioned, i.e. that the words על פי ה' יחנו ועל פי ה' יסעו את משמרת ה' שמרו which are written adjoining the paragraph instructing Moses to make the trumpets are conceptually closely connected, and that the words על פי ה' refer to both attributes, as the case may be.  If we consider that Moses was entrusted with these two trumpets and what they symbolised you can appreciate his elevated status, i.e. that he could call upon either the attribute of Justice or the attribute of Mercy at will, so to speak. This proves his status as king.  The reason the trumpets had to be made only of silver, and that no other metal was acceptable as a substitute (as opposed to the Menorah), is discussed in Menachot 28. The Talmud says that the silver used for their construction was a silver bar. Whereas smaller pieces of silver scrap were acceptable as the raw material, other metals were not. The reason there had to be two such trumpets was in order for Moses to be able to address and be addressed by the attribute of Mercy on a “face to face” basis,” as sort of a vision within a vision, there had to be two. The construction is described in the Torah as מקשה, “hammered, beaten work,” This is the mystical dimension of what is written in verse 3 ונועדו אליך כל העדה, “the tekiah element when blowing both trumpets” is the signal to assemble the entire congregation to be exposed to the communication from the attribute of Mercy which addressed the Israelites out of the fire. This is what Moses had in mind when he told the people in Deut. 4,15: “on the day the Lord spoke to you at Chorev out of the fire.” When the tekiah was blown out of only one of the trumpets this was the signal for the princes who were unique people to be assembled around Moses. Moses who was unique, would hear the voice of G’d who was unique. He was the only one who could understand the voice of the attribute of Mercy speaking to him. The teruah sound would be blown to signal that the people were to get ready to journey, part of their campaign to conquer the Holy Land. The fact that the attribute of Justice (symbolized by the teruah sound) was called upon is a compliment to the stature of the Jewish people. Seeing that no other prophet had attained the stature of Moses to be addressed both by the attribute of Mercy and the attribute of Justice on a “face to face” basis by means of the trumpets, these trumpets had to be “hidden,“ so that no one else would use them. The very words והיו לך, “they shall be yours,” which G’d said to Moses concerning these trumpets mean that only Moses would have access to these two attributes of Hashem in such a manner. Seeing these trumpets were so sacred they had to be hidden prior to Moses’ death.  Do not wonder why they were made of silver (and not of gold). The manner in which they were hammered out of one piece made it impossible to construct them of any metal other than silver. The cherubs on the kapporet of the Holy Ark were also constructed in a similar manner, (out of gold). In the case of the cherubs the attribute of Justice was subordinate to the attribute of Mercy contained within it. Hence a soft metal, gold, was used. By the same token seeing that in the case of the trumpets the situation was the reverse, i.e. that the attribute of Mercy was subordinate to the attribute of Justice which was part of it, a hard metal, silver, had to be used to symbolize that concept. Joshua was not allowed to use the trumpets and he used the shofar instead to symbolize the attribute of Justice which was poised against his enemies, the inhabitants of Jericho. David also was not allowed to use the trumpets and used the harp instead which corresponded to his principal attribute, virtue. The author draws a comparison between the word כנור and the lake called ים כנרת, (sea of Galilee). The blue applied to the tzitzit is drawn from a fish in that lake, this is why his attribute is known as כנור דוד. (Rabbi Chavell found a source in the Zohar Beshalach 48 for this.) There are kabbalistic writings explaining why תכלת represents these attributes of Justice. [Remak (Rabbi Moshe Cordovero) quotes a saying that any color one sees in one’s dream is acceptable except techelet, as this represents the attribute of Justice in its full power. Pardess Rimonim discusses the colours and their mystical significance in a chapter called שער הגוונים. Ed.]. What we learn from the above is that every great historical personality was given the tools appropriate to his spiritual level to use in communicating with G’d or on behalf of G’d."
31,28,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 33:5:2","A Midrashic approach (Pessikta Zutrata): The “king” referred to in the line ויהי בישורון מלך, is Moses, seeing that people had heard the entire Torah (legislation) from his mouth. The Torah means that the manner in which all the people including their tribal heads assembled around him, gave Moses the stature of king. This was not the first time that Moses had acted as lawgiver. It had occurred in Deut. 31,9 already when he had given the Torah to the priests, the Levites, carriers of the Holy Ark. We also find Moses ordering all the people to appear in his presence in Deut. 31,28.  Another way of understanding our verse is that the “king” described here is G’d Himself. The Torah describes that G’d became king only when all the tribal heads assembled. We find something similar described in Psalms 47,8-10 where David refers to G’d’s position as “king” in connection with the leaders of mankind indicating that they accept Him as such. In the case of the Jewish people: “when the leaders of the people volunteered to rally around Him.” We have another similar description of G’d becoming king in Amos 9,6. [The prophet portrays that G’d cannot build His chambers in heaven until an assembly of His loyal people have laid the foundation for this on earth. Ed.] The common denominator in all these verses is that G’d does not impose Himself as “king,” but waits until His creatures manifest their desire for Him to be their king."
31,28,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:28:1","הקהילו אלי, “Assemble to me, etc.” According to Tanchuma Vayechi 2, on this day Moses did not blow in the trumpets to assemble the people (elders) as was customary, and as Moses had been commanded to do in Numbers 10,2. The trumpets were for the exclusive use of Moses; they were never used by Joshua, but buried during the lifetime of Moses. This was in order to fulfill the statement of Kohelet 8,5 that on the day of one’s death one does not have authority. Seeing this was the day Moses was to die, he did not employ symbols of his authority. Blowing the shofar or the trumpets was a symbol of the authority wielded by the one who blew them or had them blown."
31,28,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:28:2","ואעידה בכם את השמים ואת הארץ, “so that I may call upon heaven and earth as witness against you.” Concerning this introductory statement, Moses continued with the words: האזינו השמים וגו' in chapter 32, 1. At this point he merely pointed out that heaven and earth would put their seal on his words at the end of the song in Haazinu. He invited heaven and earth to be present so that at the end of Haazinu they would be in a position to “sign” the document, much as witnesses to documents prepared in court are present during the preparation of the document so that they know what they are signatories to. He had made a similar statement earlier in 30,19. All of these passages were written on the same day. We have a halachah (Maimonides Hilchot Sefer Torah 7,3) that the words ואעידה, etc., have to be written at the top of the column in which the chapter commencing with the song האזינו השמים ואדברה commences. This would be the concluding letter (acronym) of the two words ב)י'ה שמ'ו), which are scattered throughout the Torah as letters which have to be written at the top of a column, i.e. the first letter of a verse respectively. Compare Genesis 49,8, Exodus 14,28; Exodus 34,11; Numbers 24,5, and our verse here commencing with the letter ו in the word ואעידה. I have already referred to this in Parshat Beshalach 14,28 in connection with the word הבאים. The letter ו in the word ואעידה is an allusion to the same letter in the tetragram. It is symbolic of the “heaven” which Moses said he is calling as witness."
31,28,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 7:10","There are other practices which, although they are not mentioned in the Talmud, have been followed by scribes as tradition, transferred from generation to generation. They include that: a) the number of lines in each column not be less than 48 nor greater than 60; b) there is a space of approximately nine letters left empty between each passage, so that one could write the word אשר three times;  c) that the five lines above the song recited at the Red Sea begin with the words: haba'im, bayabashah, י-ה-ו-ה and b'Mitzrayim, and that the five lines below that song begin with the words: vatikach, achareha, sus, vayetz'u, and vayavo'u. d) that the six lines above the song, Ha'azinu begin with the words: v'a'idah, acharei, haderech, b'acharit, l'hach'iso, and k'hal, and that the five lines below that song begin with the words: vayavo, l'daber, asher, hazot, asher."
31,28,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:28:1","They did not sound the trumpets on that day, etc. [Rashi] wishes to explain why it is not written, They should sound [the trumpets], as it is written in Parshas Beha'aloscha (Bamidbar 10:2) when he gathered them.
"
31,28,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 31:28:2","And even during his lifetime they were concealed before the day he died, etc. This means that if you were to say that Yehoshua had no control over them, nevertheless he should have blown them, for Moshe was still alive! Therefore Rashi explains that even in his lifetime, etc. In other words, it is understandable if Yehoshua would have control over them after Moshe's death, they would have blown them even on the day that Moshe died. However, since Yehoshua did not have control over them after Moshe's death, it is proper that they be concealed on the day that Moshe died, and Moshe would not use his authority over them on the day of his death to fulfill the verse which states, There is no dominion on the day of death (Koheles 8:8). In other words, the authority that a person has had all his life does not remain on the day of his death. One cannot ask Why were they concealed? Even if they had not been concealed, the [people] would not have blown them. One can answer that even this would be a display of authority, that even though they were still there, Yehoshua was not permitted to use them, and therefore they were concealed. Similarly we find regarding King David of blessed memory, in every place he is mentioned he is referred to as King David. Yet on the day he died it is written, And the days of David drew near to die” (I Melochim 2:1), for this same reason, [because] there is no dominion on the day of death, etc. "
31,28,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Ha'Azinu 1:1","Listen, heavens and I will speak: Happy is the one born of a woman who says like this to the creation of the Heavens. As a king would say to his servants, ""Listen and hear my words""; so did he say to the heavens and the earth, ""Be quiet until all of my words are finished."" ""Listen, heavens"": This is what is stated in the verse (Jeremiah 32:36) - ""If the heavens above could be measured, and the foundations of the earth below could be fathomed, then would I also reject all the seed of Israel."" Since they exist forever and Israel exists forever, they were summoned to testify that Israel is observing the Torah and the commandments. But if, God forbid, they negate them, the hand of the witnesses will be the first against them, to kill them. It is written (Deuteronomy 11:17), ""and He will shut up the skies and there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produce."" Hence, he summoned them to testify when Israel is observing the Torah and the commandments. But if, God forbid, they refuse, the hand of the witnesses will be the first against them, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 31:28), ""and I will bring the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you."" And this is why he brought them for testimony - as it is [found] in the Pesikta [that] man is compared to the twelve constellations: At the beginning when he is born, he is compared to a lamb, as he is soft, but he grows up to be like an ox. When he grows [older], he becomes twins, meaning to say complete, and the evil impulse grows in him. And at the beginning, it is weak like a crab; but afterwards when it grows, it becomes strong like a lion. And if he sins, it becomes like a virgin. And if he adds [more] transgressions, they are measured in the scales. And if he continues in his rebellion, he is brought down to the pit below, to the pit and Geihinom - like a scorpion placed in the earth and in ditches. But if he repents, he is thrown out - like one who slings his arrows with a bow. That is why we are accustomed to mention the dead on Shabbat, so that they do not return to Geihinom. As so is it [found] in Torat Kohanim (on Deuteronomy 21:8), ""'Atone for your people' - those are the living; 'that You have redeemed' - those are the dead. From here, [we learn] that the living redeem the dead."" Hence we are accustomed to mention the dead on Yom Kippur and to distribute charity for their sake. As so did we learn in Torat Kohanim, ""It is possible that from when they died, charity does not help them. [Hence] we learn to say, 'that You have redeemed.'"" From here, [we learn] that when we distribute charity for their sake, we take them out and bring them up like an arrow from the bow. He [then] immediately becomes soft like a goat and is rendered pure like the time that he was born, and we pour pure water from a pail upon him.  And he grows with great pleasure like a fish enjoying the water. So does he immerse at all times in the rivers of afarsimon and milk, and oil and honey; and he always eats from the tree of life that is planted inside the partition of the righteous, and its branches leans over the table of each and every righteous one. And he lives forever. To here is new. But from here and onward is from the old."

31,28,Quoting Commentary,"Machzor Vitry, Laws of Sefer Torah 519:2","2 Masekhet Soferim has different definitions: a petuha is anything which  does not start at the head of the line. A setuma is anything that stops in the middle of the line. How much must be left at the beginning of the line for it to be called a petuha? Enough to write a word of three letters. How much must be left in the middle of the line for it to be called a setuma? Enough to write a word of three letters. [End Masekhet Soferim quote.] Suppose he finished a paragraph at the edge of the page and started a new line, and left enough space at the beginning of that line to write three letters, and then started to write? Come and learn from the two sources; the baraita gives the essence of the issue. The baraita reasons that the beginning of the line is what determines a petuha, not the end of the line [so the example case is a petuha according to the baraita]; if one leaves a gap at the beginning and also at the end of the line, it is still a petuha. But the old siddur reasons that it is the end of the line that determines a petuha, not the beginning of the line [so the example case is a setuma according to the baraita]. [To avoid ambiguity, therefore...] if he makes a petuha with space both at the end of the line and at the beginning of the line it is good for both of them. This is correct. There is also another order of petuhot and setumot which seems entirely unconvincing. And these are the tagin of a sefer Torah and the petuhot and setumot according to the masoretic tradition. ביה שמו: the following words should be placed at the beginning of a line and the top of a column: Bereshit (Gen. 1:1); Yehudah ata yodukha (Gen. 49:8); Haba-im ahareihem bayam (Ex. 14:28); Shemor ve-shamarta (Deut. 12:28); Motza sefateikha (Deut. 23:24); Ve-a'ida bam (Deut. 31:28)."
31,28,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,"RASHEICHEM SHIVTEICHEM.’ In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra this means rasheichem rashei shivteichem (“your heads, the heads of your tribes”), (Since a noun in the construct form cannot have a pronoun suffix, the term rasheichem cannot mean “your heads of.” Therefore Ibn Ezra adds the words rashei, interpreting the phrase as “your heads, ‘the heads of’ your tribes.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 283 for the same principle as applied to another example.)  like and the prophecy of Oded the prophet (Chronicles 15:8. Here the point is that a noun in the construct form cannot have the prefix hei indicating the definite article. Hence the word v’hanevuah cannot mean “and the prophecy of.” We must therefore add the word nevuath, meaning: “and the prophecy, ‘a prophecy of’ Oded.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 284 where the same example is mentioned.)  [which means “and the prophecy, the prophecy of Oded the prophet”]. (Chronicles 15:8. Here the point is that a noun in the construct form cannot have the prefix hei indicating the definite article. Hence the word v’hanevuah cannot mean “and the prophecy of.” We must therefore add the word nevuath, meaning: “and the prophecy, ‘a prophecy of’ Oded.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 284 where the same example is mentioned.)  In my opinion the verse generalizes and then specifies. The generalization is: “your heads and all your tribes,” and then it specifies your elders, and your officers who are your heads, for the elder and the man of rank, he is the head. (Isaiah 9:14.)  Similarly, he stated Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, (Further 31:28.)  for any person who has authority and appointive power over the public is called rosh (head). Thus it is said of the princes [of the tribes], they were ‘the heads of’ the thousands of Israel, (Numbers 1:16.)  for they were the highest rank of all the thousands of Israel. And it is stated of the spies, [all of them were] ‘heads of’ the children of Israel, (Ibid., 13:3.)  meaning they were “among” the heads of the children of Israel, not the heads of all the children of Israel — and they were all included in the term your heads. He then stated again even all the men of Israel who comprise your tribes. Then he mentioned further the little children, the women, the strangers, the hewers of wood and drawers of water (Verse 10.)  whom they had from among the mixed multitude. (Exodus 12:38.)  He had made them bring the little ones, in order to include them in the covenant, for he made the covenant even with the future generations, (Verses 13-14.)  or [the children may have been brought] to make them [i.e., the parents] deserving of Divine reward for bringing them, like the reason the Rabbis gave regarding [the commandment of] the Assembly. (See Ramban further 31:13.)  And our Rabbis have said (So mentioned by Rashi. Ramban himself further on refers to a similar text from the Tanchuma. See further, Note 18.)  that some Canaanites [posing as proselytes] came in Moses’ days just as they came in Joshua’s days (Joshua 9:2-27.)  and Moses made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the Tabernacle of G-d. (Ibid., Verse 27. The verse there states: for ‘the altar of’ G-d.)  Now, the intent of the Rabbis is not to state that these Canaanites deceived Moses [as they misled Joshua]; instead, they came to him to make peace with him, for such is the law as we have explained. (See above, 20:11.)  Thus I found in Midrash Tanchuma: (Tanchuma, Nitzavim 2.)  “This teaches you that they [the Canaanites] came before Moses and he did not accept them.” That is to say, they could not deceive him into making a covenant with them, but he immediately made them hewers of wood and drawers of water."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

31,28,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 31:28,"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, and I will speak these words in their ears, and I will call the heavens and the earth to testify for them. They must hear the matters that will be spoken before the heavens and the earth, which are the everlasting witnesses."
31,28,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 1:3","The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Devarim 31:28), “...and I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them.” This is because Bnei Yisrael clarify and rejoice in the inner essence of creation, testifying that everything is the power of Hashem. This concept aligns with Shabbos, called a testimony. When one says “Vayechulu” on Friday night, he becomes a partner in creation, affirming that everything is Hashem. The truth is that as one realizes this, nothing remains hidden. The souls of Bnei Yisrael are above nature, and hence nature cannot truly conceal this fact. This is the meaning of (Devarim 29:9), “You are standing here today before Hashem your G-d,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael, as the source of life force, stand directly before Hashem. They are the first step through which everything descends. Rashi (Devarim 29:12) explains that Hashem told the parsha of Nitzavim after the curses to console Bnei Yisrael, whose faces had turned pale. Hashem reassured them, saying that just as the day turns from dark to light, so too will He bring light to them. This aligns with the idea that Bnei Yisrael, being the initial conduit for divine light, have the power to transform everything. The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 8:1) states, “everything is created in its time,” meaning the beginning of the spreading of life force from Hashem into the realm of time. The Zohar elaborates on this (Zohar 3:58a) with the phrase “And he shall not enter at any time,” referring to the sanctity of timing in divine service. This concept is mirrored in the act of standing in prayer, as in “Atem nitzavim” (Devarim 29:9). When one acknowledges and humbles himself before Hashem, he aligns himself with Klal Yisrael, who are always standing before Hashem, nullifying himself to divine will."
31,28,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 2:2","The Chidushei Harim explained Devarim 31:28, “…I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael clarify that all creation is from Hashem. The Midrash uses the word “Nitzavim” (standing) to liken Bnei Yisrael to a target, similar to a warrior aiming at a beam, signifying that they were created to guard and nullify external forces. The term “Nitzavim” also refers to protectors, as in Shmuel 2 (8:14), “He stationed garrisons (nitzavim) in Edom.”"
31,28,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 31:28:1","ואעידה בם את השמים ואת הארץ, “and I will appoint as witnesses against them Heaven and Earth.” Here Moses actually appointed Heaven and Earth as witnesses, while earlier (in verse 30.19) he merely told the Jewish people that  these would be witnesses against them."
31,28,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 96:3,"“The time for Israel…approached.” It is written: “There is no person who rules the spirit to retain the spirit, and there is no dominion on the day of death” (Ecclesiastes 8:8). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: The trumpets that Moses crafted in the wilderness, when he was tending toward death, the Holy One blessed be He sequestered them so that another would not sound it, and they would come to him, as it is written: “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes” (Deuteronomy 31:28). (Moses asked that the elders be assembled; he did not merely have someone blow the trumpets, as he would have done in the past, because they had been sequestered. )  This was to realize what is written: “There is no dominion on the day of death.”  Another matter, “there is no dominion on the day of death” – when Zimri performed that action, (He brought a Midyanite woman into his tent. )  what is written there? “He went after the man of Israel into the tent” (Numbers 25:8). (This is stated about Pinḥas. )  Where was Moses? And would Pinḥas speak before Moses? Rather, it is to realize: “There is no dominion on the day of death.” Death is nothing other than an expression of lowering. Salvation was given to Pinḥas, and Moses was lowered. (Moses’s death was drawing near, and so others began to assert authority. )  Of David, too, it is written: “King David was old” (I Kings 1:1). When he was about to die, what is written in his regard? “The time for King David [to die] approached” is not written here, but, rather, “the time for David [to die] approached” (I Kings 2:1). Jacob, too, when he was about to die, he began lowering himself before Joseph, and he said to him: “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes.” When? It was when he approached death, as it is stated: “The time for Israel to die approached.”"
31,28,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 15:15,"“Craft for you” – from your own. “Craft for you” – for yourself you craft, but not for another. You use them, but another does not use them. Know that Joshua, Moses’s disciple, did not use them, but rather shofars. When he came to wage war in Jericho, seven nations assembled in Jericho, as it is stated:  “You crossed the Jordan, and you came to Jericho; the masters of Jericho made war against you, the Emorites, the Perizites, the Canaanites, the Hitites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Yevusites, and I delivered them into your hand” (Joshua 24:11). Were the masters of Jericho seven nations? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Jericho was the safeguard of the Land of Israel. If Jericho is conquered, immediately the rest of the Land will be conquered. That is why the seven nations assembled in it. What is written there? “The people shouted, and they sounded the shofars” (Joshua 6:20) – it teaches that even his disciple Joshua did not use them.   Do not say only for Joshua, but even Moses, as they were sequestered while he was still alive. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Moses says, when he comes to take his leave of the world: “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your foremen” (Deuteronomy 31:28). Where were the trumpets to sound and assemble them? It is, rather, that  they were sequestered while he was still alive. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi said: It is to realize what is stated: “There is no dominion on the day of death” (Ecclesiastes 8:8). That is, “craft for you two silver trumpets” – craft them for you, and no one else will use them all the days of your life."
31,28,Midrash,Bereshit Rabbah 96:2,"“The time for Israel to die approached and he called his son, Joseph, and he said to him: Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, please place your hand under my thigh and perform kindness and truth with me; please do not bury me in Egypt” (Genesis 47:29).  “The time for Israel to die approached.” It is written: “For I am a stranger with You, a resident, [as were all my fathers]” (Psalms 39:13). “For we are strangers before You…our days on earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope” (I Chronicles 29:15) – if only it would be like the shadow of a wall, or the shadow of a tree, (If our life is compared to a shadow, if only it could be like the shadow of a wall or tree, which stays in place and has stability.)  but instead it is like the shadow of a bird when it is flying, as it is written: “Like a passing shadow” (Psalms 144:4). “And there is no hope” – there is no one who can hope not to die. Everyone knows and says with his mouth that he will die. Abraham said: “I am going (“Going” here is in the sense of dying.)  childless” (Genesis 15:2). Isaac said: “I will bless you before the Lord before my death” (Genesis 27:7). Jacob, too, said: “I will lie with my fathers” (Genesis 47:30). When [did he say this]? When he was about to die."
31,29,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:29:1,"אחרי מותי כי השחת תשחתון [FOR I KNOW THAT] AFTER MY DEATH YE WILL UTTERLY CORRUPT YOURSELVES — But, you see, as a matter of fact, that all the days of Joshua they did not corrupt themselves, for it states, (Judges 2:7) “And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua”?! (How, then, could Moses say that they would corrupt themselves after his death, by which he evidently meant immediately after his death, cf. v. 16)? But we may derive from here that one’s pupil should be as dear to him as his own self: — it appeared to Moses that so long as Joshua would live it would be as though he himself would be living (he thus alluded by the words “after my death” to a period after Joshua’s death)."
31,29,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 31:29:1,"[BEFALL YOU.] The meaning of ve-karata (and…will befall you) is similar to ve-chatat (but the fault is) in but the fault is in thine people (Ex. 5:15). (Both words are perfects which become imperfects because of the conversive vav.)  It is explained there. (See I.E. on Ex. 5:16 (Vol. 2, p. 123).) "
31,29,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 31:29,"For I know after my death, that you will become depraved and you will veer from the way that I commanded you; and harm will happen to you at the end of time, when you do what is wicked in [before] Adonoy’s eyes to spite [before] Him with your actions."
31,29,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 31:29,"For I know that after my death corrupting you will corrupt your works, and go astray from the way I have commanded you, and that evil will befall you in the end, because you will do what is wrong before the Lord in provoking Him to anger.

31,29,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:29:1,"כי ידעתי, in the course of that song (poem) I will reveal that I know how you will act so that the evil, if and when it befalls you, will not be perceived as “bad luck,” as coincidence, but can be traced back to my warnings. Once you realise and admit hat you had become guilty of a corrupt way of life, you will repent and turn to G’d in sincere remorse. Compare Isaiah 48,5 ואגיד לך מאז, בטרם תבוא השמעתיך, פן תאמר עצבי אשם, “Therefore I told you long beforehand, announced things to you before they happened, that you might not say: “my idol caused them.”
"
31,29,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 4:22:1,"כי אנכי מת, I have to warn you very insistently, seeing that I will not be crossing the Jordan with you. Compare Deuteronomy 31,29 where Moses predicts the corruption of the people at some point after his death."
31,29,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 16:11:2,"וקראת שמו, the letter ת at the end is a feminine ending future tense, i.e. ""you will call."" On the other hand, in Deut. 31,29 the same word וקראת אתכם refers to a third person feminine construction where the letter ת substitutes for the letter ה, the expression meaning: ""it will befall you."" The reference is to the רעה, evil, a noun that is feminine which follows immediately after the word אתכם."
31,29,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 49:22:1,"בן פרת יוסף בן פרת עלי עין, the branch סעיף, is referred to as בן, as it is an offshoot of the tree. Seeing that it is called בן in the masculine mode, he word פרת, the adjective modifying it, ought to be in the masculine mode also, but it is not. Suddenly, the Torah changes grammar in mid-stream and speaks of בנות צעדה עלי עין instead of בנים צעדו עלי עין, “his branches spilling (running) over the wall.” The reason is that the word סעיף also occurs as a feminine noun, as in Ezekiel 31,6 בסעפתיו קננו, “in its boughs they made their nest.” Such nouns in a dual role are not that rare, as for instance we find the חמור, male donkey, treated as if it were an אתון, the she-ass in Samuel II 19,27 אחבשה לי החמור וארכב עליה, “I will saddle my donkey and ride on her.” The donkey is both a beast, בהמה, a feminine noun, and a male of its species. We are therefore free to use either gender when referring to it. A similar example is found in Exodus 22,25 where the Torah describes the word שלמה, dress, as masculine although generally we always use it as feminine. The fact is that the specific garment “dress, שלמה,” is at the same time a garment, בגד, a noun describing all garments, a masculine noun. While a bough, פארה, is indeed a feminine noun, referring to a specific type of branch, the word סעיף includes many types of branches and is a masculine noun. There are quite a few examples of this grammatical phenomenon. As to the addition of the letter ת in פרת, it substitutes for the letter ה as it does on many occasions. Look at Deuteronomy 31,29 for instance, where we have וקראת instead of וקראה."
31,29,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar 85:1,"(Bamidbar 11:1) ""And the people were ['vayehi'] as seekers of a pretext"": ""vayehi"" connotes return to a previous condition, i.e., they were perverse to begin with, and they reverted to their original perversity. ""And the people"": ""the people"" connotes the wicked ones, as in (Shemot 17:4) ""What can I do to this people?"", (Bamidbar 14:4) ""How long will this people provoke Me?"" (Jeremiah 13:10) ""this evil people who refuse to hear My words."" And when He calls them ""My people,"" this connotes the upright ones, as in (Shemot 7:16) ""Send My people and let them serve Me,"" (Michah 6:3) ""My people, what (wrong) did I do to you, and how did I tire you? Testify against Me!"", (Ibid. 5) ""My people, remember now, etc."" And the people were kemithonenim"": ""mithonenim"" connotes ""grumblers,"" seekers of a pretest to abandon the L-rd, as in the instance of Yoram the son of Achav, viz. (II Kings 5:7) ""Know now and see that he seeks a pretext (mithaneh) against me,"" and in the instance of Samson, viz. (Judges 14:4) ""for he was seeking a pretext (toanah) against the Philistines."" R. Eliezer says: ""kemithonenim"" connotes ""blows,"" as in (Proverbs 26:22) ""The words of the grumbler are like blows,"" and in (Devarim 1:23) ""And you 'grumbled' in your tents."" What is ""blows"" (in our context)? They were as strikers of blows, but a ""knife"" descended from heaven and split their innards, viz. (Proverbs, Ibid.) ""and they descend to the recesses of the stomach."" R. Yehudah says: ""kemithonenim"" connotes those who afflict themselves, as in (Devarim 26:19) ""I did not eat in my mourning (be'oni) of it."" Rebbi says: ""kemithonenim ra [evil]"": ""evil"" (in this context) is idolatry, as in (Devarim 31:29) ""for you will do evil in the eyes of the L-rd."" ""in the ears of the L-rd"": We are hereby taught that Israel deliberately intended to have Him hear (their words). R. Shimon says: An analogy: A man is cursing the king, when the king passes by. They tell him: Hush! the king might hear! And he says: Who told you that I don't want him to hear! So, (in this instance) Israel wanted the L-rd to hear. He heard and His wrath burned in them. ""and the fire of the L-rd burned in them"": Fire descended from heaven and ""rained blows"" upon them until they could not tell the difference between the living and the dead. But whom did the fire strike first? — ""and it (the fire) devoured 'biktzei' of the camp."" Some say (this refers to) the proselytes, who were muktzim (""cast off"") in the end (""katzeh"") of the camp. R. Shimon b. Menassia says: ""and it devoured 'biktzei' of the camp"": in the ketzinim, (their officers), their great men, as in (Judges 11:11) ""and the people set him as a leader and a chief (katzin) over them."""
31,29,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 32:12:2,"ואין עמו אל נכר AND THERE WAS NO STRANGE GOD WITH HIM — for not one of the gods of the other peoples possessed the power to display its might and to war with them. — Our Rabbis, however, explained it as a promise referring to the future (cf. Sifrei Devarim 315), and so, too, does Onkelos render it. But I say that they (the statements of this chapter) are words of reproof which he said with the view of calling heaven and earth as witnesses against them, and also in order that this song (cf. Deuteronomy 31:21) should be witness, because He knew (Deuteronomy 31:29) that they would in future prove faithless and would bear in mind neither the past (lit., the first) deeds that He performed for them nor those that would come to pass (lit., that would be born), which at a future time He would do for them. For this reason it is necessary to make the text fit in with this and with that (the past and the future). Indeed, the whole section is to be connected with (v. 7) “Remember the days of old (i.e., the past), consider the years of generation after generation” (the future) (cf. Rashi on that verse): Thus has He done for them and thus will He in the future do for them — all this they ought to bear in mind."
31,29,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 11:10,"Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Ten “deaths” are written in Moses’s regard, and these are: “Behold, your time to die is approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14); “die on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 32:50); “for I will die ” (Deuteronomy 4:22); “for I know, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:29); “and so, too, after my death” (Deuteronomy 31:27); “before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1); “one hundred and tweny years old upon his death” (Deuteronomy 34:7); “Moses, the servant of God, died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5); “it was after Moses’s death” (Joshua 1:1); “Moses My servant died” (Joshua 1:2). It teaches that as many as ten times it was decreed against him that he would not enter the Land of Israel, but his harsh sentence was not sealed until the High Court (The supernal High Court.)  revealed itself to him. He [God] said to him: ‘It is a decree from before Me that you will not cross,’ as it is stated: “For you will not cross the Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27). This matter was not consequential in Moses’s eyes, as he said: ‘Israel performed great sins several times, and when I asked for mercy, He immediately accepted it from Me, as it is stated: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). What is written there? “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14). “I will smite them with the pestilence, and I will destroy them” (Numbers 14:12). What is written there? “The Lord said: “I have pardoned…” (Numbers 14:20); I, who have not sinned since my youth, all the more so that when I pray for myself, He will accept it from me.’   When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the matter was inconsequential in Moses’s eyes, and that he was not standing in prayer, He immediately seized the opportunity and took an oath in His great Name that he [Moses] would not enter the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “Therefore [lakhen], you will not bring this assembly [into the land that I have given them]” (Numbers 20:12), and lakhen is nothing other than an oath, as it is stated: “Therefore, I have taken an oath to the house of Eli” (I Samuel 3:14).  When Moses saw that his sentence had been sealed, he decreed a fast upon himself, drew a small circle, stood within it, and said: ‘I am not moving from here until You void this decree.’ At that moment, what did Moses do? He donned sackcloth, wrapped himself in sackcloth, covered himself with ashes, and stood in prayer and supplication before the Holy One blessed be He, until the heavens, the earth, and the order of Creation shook violently, and they said: ‘Perhaps, the desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has arrived.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The desire of the Holy One blessed be He to renew His world has not arrived. Rather: “In whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man”’ (Job 12:10), and man is no one other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses was very humble, more than any person on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3). What did the Holy One blessed be He do at that moment? He proclaimed at each and every gate of each and every firmament and each and every court that they should not accept Moses’ prayer and they should not take it up before Him, because the decree had been sealed in his regard. The angel who is appointed over proclamation, his name is Akazriel. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called in a frenzy, and said to the ministering angels: ‘Descend in a frenzy and lock the gates of each and every firmament,’ as the voice of the prayer was forcing its way upward to the firmament due to the sound of Moses’s prayer, as his prayer was like a sword that rips and cuts and cannot be delayed. His prayer was like the ineffable Name that he learned from Zagzael, the master scribe of the residents of the upper world.  Regarding that moment it says: “A wind lifted me, and I heard behind me the sound of a great noise [raash]: Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12). Raash is nothing other than quaking, and great is nothing other than Moses, as it is stated: “The man Moses, too, was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people” (Exodus 11:3). What is “blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place”? When the wheels of the divine chariot and the seraphs of fire saw that the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Do not accept Moses’s prayer,’ and He did not show him favor, did not grant him life, and did not allow him to enter the Land of Israel, they said: “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place,” as there is no favoritism, neither for the small nor the great.  From where is it derived that Mosed prayed during that period five hundred and fifteen times? It is as it is stated: “I pleaded [vaetḥanan] with the Lord at that time, saying” (Deuteronomy 3:23) – that is the numerical value of vaetḥanan. (Vav – 6, alef – 1, tav – 400, ḥet – 8, nun – 50, nun sofit – 50.)  At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is revealed and known before You, my exertion, and the suffering that I underwent for Israel, until they would believe in Your Name. How much suffering I underwent for them regarding the mitzvot, until I bolstered the Torah and the mitzvot in them? I said: Just as I saw their trouble, so, I will see their well-being, but now, when the well-being of Israel has arrived, You say to me: “You will not cross this Jordan”? You are rendering Your Torah a forgery, as it is written: “On his day you shall give his wage, and the sun shall not set upon it as he is poor, and he anticipates it, lest he cry out against you to the Lord and it will be a sin in you” (Deuteronomy 24:15). Is this payment for the work of forty years that I toiled, until they would become a sacred and loyal people? As it is stated: “But Judah still ruled with God, and he is faithful to the Holy One” (Hosea 12:1).  The wicked angel Samael was the head of all the accusing angels. Each moment, he would count toward Moses’s death and say: ‘When will the end arrive, the moment when Moses will die, so I can descend and take his soul from him?’ In his regard, David said: “The wicked man looks upon the righteous man and seeks to kill him” (Psalms 37:32). You have none among the accusing angels as wicked as Samael, and you have none among the prophets as righteous as Moses, as it is stated: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10). To what is the matter comparable? It is to a person who happened upon the feast of a bride and groom, and that person was anticipating and saying: ‘When will their rejoicing arrive and I will rejoice in it?’  So, the wicked Samael was anticipating Moses’s soul, and saying: ‘When will Mikhael (Mikhael is the ministering angel of Israel. See Daniel 12:1, Yoma 77a.)  weep and I will fill my mouth with laughter?’ Until Mikhael said to him: ‘What, wicked one, will I weep and you laugh? “Do not rejoice, my enemy, over me; though I fell, I will rise; though I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me”’ (Micah 7:8). “Though I fell” – due to Moses’ passing, “I will rise” – due to Joshua’s leadership, when he toppled the thirty-one kings. (See Joshua 12:7–24.)  “Though I sit in darkness” – with the destruction of the first and latter Temple, “the Lord is a light for me” – in the messianic era.’  Up to this point, one hour had passed. At that moment, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me in this world, and I will live and not die.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘If I do not kill you in this world, how will I revive you in the World to Come? Moreover, you will render My Torah a forgery, as it is written in My Torah by your hand: “There is no deliverer from My hand”’ (Deuteronomy 32:39).  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel, leave me like the beasts of the field, who eat greenery, drink water, live, and see the world. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you, [do not continue to speak to Me of this matter]” (Deuteronomy 3:26). He said before him: ‘Master of the universe, if not, leave me in this world, like this bird that flies in all directions of the world, and gathers its sustenance each day, and in the evening it returns to its nest. So, let my soul be like one of them.’ He said to him: “Enough for you.” What is “enough for you”? He said to him: ‘It is enough for you what you have spoken.’ When Moses saw that no creature could save him from the path of death, at that moment, he said: “The Rock, His actions are perfect, as all His ways are justice; a faithful God and there is no injustice, righteous and upright is He” (Deuteronomy 32:4).  What did Moses do? He took the scroll and wrote on it the ineffable Name and the book of the song. (The song of Haazinu (Deuteronomy 32).)  But he did not yet complete it until the moment arrived for Moses to die. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said to Gavriel: ‘Gavriel, go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, one who is the equivalent of sixty myriads, how can I see his death? And one who possesses these qualities, how can I act toward him with fury?’ Then He said to Mikhael: ‘Go out and bring Moses soul.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I was his teacher, and he was my disciple, and I am not able to see his death.’ Then He said to the wicked Samael: ‘Go out and bring Moses’ soul.’ Immediately, he clothed himself in anger and girded himself with a sword, wrapped himself in cruelty, and went toward Moses. When he saw him that he was sitting and writing the ineffable Name, [that] the aura of his appearance was like the sun, and [that] he resembled an angel of the Lord of hosts, Samael grew fearful of Moses. He said: ‘The angels can certainly not take Moses’ soul.’ Before Samael showed himself to Moses, Moses knew that Samael had come. When Samael saw Moses, a fearful trembling seized him, like the pangs of a woman giving birth, and he was unable to open his mouth to speak to Moses, until Moses said to Samael: ‘“There is no peace, said the Lord, for the wicked” (Isaiah 48:22); what are you doing here?’ He said to him: ‘I came to take your soul.’ He said to him: ‘Who sent you?’ He said to him: ‘The One who created all the creations.’ He said to him: ‘You will not take my soul.’ He said to him: ‘Anyone who comes into the world, their souls are given to me.’ He said to him: ‘'I have greater strength than anyone [else] who comes into the world.’   He said to him: ‘What is your strength?’ He said to him: ‘I am the son of Amram, I emerged circumcised from my mother’s womb, and there was no need to circumcise me. On the day that I was born, I was able to speak, I walked on my feet, I spoke with my father and my mother, and I did not even suck milk. When I was three months old, I prophesied and said that I was destined to receive the Torah from fiery flames. When I was walking outside, I entered the king’s palace and took the crown from upon his head. When I was eighty years old, I performed signs and wonders in Egypt: I took out sixty myriads before the eyes of all Egypt; I split the sea into twelve sections; I sweetened the water of Mara; I ascended and trod a path in the heavens; I engaged in the battle of the angels; I received a Torah of fire; I resided under a throne of fire; took shelter under a pillar of fire; I spoke with Him face to face; I prevailed over the heavenly entourage; I revealed their secrets to humankind; I received Torah from the right [hand] of the Holy One blessed be He, and taught it to Israel. I waged war with Siḥon and with Og, two mighty idol worshippers, who during the Flood, the water did not reach their ankles due to their height. I caused the sun and the moon to stand still in the heights, and I struck them with the staff in my hand and I killed them. Who is there among those who come into the world who can do that? Go from here, wicked one, you must not say that. (That you came to take my soul.)  Go, flee from before me, I will not give my soul to you.’  Immediately, Samael returned and brought the response before the Almighty. The Holy One blessed be He said to Samael: 'Come and bring Moses’ soul.' He immediately drew his sword from his scabbard and stood over Moses. Moses immediately became furious at him, took in his hand his staff, on which the ineffable Name was inscribed, and smote Samael with all his strength, until he fled from before him. He pursued him with the ineffable Name, and removed the beam of glory from between his eyes and blinded his eyes. Until this point, Moses was successful. A moment later, a Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘The end, your death, has arrived.’  Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, remember that day that You revealed Yourself to me at the bush, and said to me: “And now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and take My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt”? (Exodus 3:10). Remember that day that I was standing upon Mount Sinai for forty days and forty night? I ask You, please, do not hand me over to the angel of death.’ A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: ‘Fear not, I, Myself, will tend to you and to your burial.’ At that moment, Moses stood and sanctified himself, like the seraphs.   The Holy One blessed be He descended from the uppermost heavens of heavens to take Moses’ soul, and there were three ministering angels with him: Mikhael, Gavriel, and Zagzagel: Mikhael prepared Moses’ bier, Gavriel spread a fine linen cloth at his head, and Zagzagel at his feet. Mikhael on one side and Gavriel on one side. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Cover your eyes with your eyelids’ and he covered his eyes with his eyelids. He said to him: ‘Place your hands on your chest,’ and he placed his hands on his chest. He said to him: ‘Place your feet one next to the other.’ He placed his feet one next to the other.   At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He summoned the soul from within his body. He said to it: ‘My daughter, one hundred and twenty years I allotted for your being in Moses’ body. Now, your end has arrived, it is time to leave. Depart, do not delay.’ It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I know that You are the God of all the spirits and all the souls. The soul of the living and the dead  are given into Your hand. You created me, You formed me, and you placed me in Moses’ body for one hundred and twenty years. Now, is there a body in the world purer than Moses’s body? As no putrid wind was ever seen in him, and no worms or maggots. That is why I love it and do not wish to depart from it.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Soul, depart, do not delay, and I will take you up to the uppermost heavens of heavens, I will seat you beneath My Throne of Glory with the cherubs, the seraphs, and the troops.’ (Troops of angels.)    It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from near your Divine Presence on High, two angels, Uza and Azael, descended and lusted after earthly women and corrupted their way on the earth until you suspended them between the earth and the heavens. But the son of Amram, from the day that You revealed Yourself to him, he did not consort with his wife, as it is stated: “Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses with regard to the Kushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Kushite woman” (The midrash here is based on the interpretation that they were talking about the fact that Moses abstained from being with his wife. See Rashi on Numbers 12:1.)  (Numbers 12:1). I ask You please: Leave me in Moses’ body.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He kissed him, and took his soul with a kiss on the mouth.   The Holy One blessed be He began weeping: “Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against the evildoers?” (Psalms 94:16). And the Divine Presence says: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10). The heavens weep and say: “The pious one is lost from the land” (Micah 7:2). The earth weeps and says: “The upright among men is no more” (Micah 7:2). When Joshua sought his master but did not find him, he was weeping and saying: “Help, Lord, for the faithful man is no more, for trustworthiness has disappeared from among men” (Psalms 12:2). The ministering angels say: “He executed the righteousness of God” (Deuteronomy 33:21), and Israel said: “And His ordinances with Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:21). These and those were saying: “May he come in peace, may they rest on their resting places, one who walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2).   “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7), and his soul for life in the World to Come. Amen, so, may it be His will. “Blessed be the Lord forever, amen and amen” (Psalms 89:53)."

Thus it is stated (in Deut. 31:16): THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND. For that reason Moses warned them (in Deut. 31:29): FOR I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL SURELY ACT CORRUPTLY. But they said to him: We will not do this thing. He said to them: You are going to beget CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN and forget the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Deut. 4:26; 30:19): I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY….

31,29,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:29:1","אחרי מותי כי השחת תשחתון, “after my death, that you will become very corrupt, etc.” History shows that during all of the years when Joshua was in charge of the people they did not become corrupt but remained loyal to the Torah. This fact is specifically attested to near the end of the Book of Joshua (Joshua 24,31) “the people served Hashem all the days of Joshua as well as during all of the days of the elders who lived longer than Joshua.” Our sages derive from this verse that “a teacher treasures his disciple as much as he treasures his own body,” (loves himself) seeing that as long as Joshua was alive, Moses had the feeling that he himself was still alive. The corruption Moses speaks of here is the practice of idolatry (Temurah 28). This is also what he had in mind when he said: “to anger Him with your handiwork.” Moses had a prophetic vision of the idolatry which would be practiced during the period of the first Temple."
31,29,Quoting Commentary,"Redeeming Relevance; Deuteronomy, CHAPTER 1 Moshe's Obsession with the Spies 54","In Moshe’s eyes, the Jews were capable of meriting a miraculous and highly intensive manifestation of the Divine presence. Had they realized that potential, Moshe would have crossed the Jordan and helped establish a kingdom of God on earth. Instead, the Jews would need to start near the beginning, and from there it would be necessary to go through many centuries of trials and tribulations before they would be ready to create God’s kingdom on earth once again. (See Devarim 31:29, where Moshe tells the Jews that he knows that they will sin.) "
31,29,Quoting Commentary,"Hasagot HaRa'avad on Mishneh Torah, Repentance 6:5:1","Now.. is it not written etc. These are unseasoned, lengthy words; by the life of my head, I am tempted to say, they are childish words. Should the Creator say to the perverters: ""Why did thou turn aside, I made no mention of thy name, to afford thee the excuse of saying that I decreed it against thee"", the perverters will say to Him: ""Upon whom then is Thy decree applicable, if on those who did not turn aside, behold, Thy decree was not established"". But of, this Verse ""And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land"", we long ago suggested that in the subject of the foreknowledge of God there is no connection with predestination, much less can it be utilized here, seeing that even Moses said: ""For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly"" (Deut. 31.29), and preceding this he, moreover, said: ""Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?"". How much more, then could the Creator speak thus without it being a decree? As for the subject of the Egyptians, it is no question at all for two reasons: first, it is a known doctorine that God inflicts no punishment against a wicked man unless it be through a more wicked man than he, whenafter that wicked man will have retribution visited upon him; For, so it is said: ""O Ashur, the rod of Mine anger"", (Is. 10.5), but, ""When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spiled"" (Ibid. 33.1); because of thy wickedness, and haughtiness of thy heart, and vain glory against Me. The Egyptians, too, were wicked and it was meet that they receive the plagues; yet, if they had listened to Moses at first and let the children of Irsael go forth, they would neither have been plagued nor drowned in the Red Sea; but the spitefulness of Pharoah, and his insulting words against the Creator in the presence of His messenger caused the punishment to be visited upon him. Second, because the Creator said: ""And they shall afflict them"" (Gen. 15.13), but they afflicted them with rigour, put some of them to death, and killed others by drowning, as the subject is spoken of saying: ""I was but a little angry, but they helped for evil"" (Zech. 1.15); they were, therefore, found guilty"".  (Rabbi Abraham De Butin, too, criticises Maimonides for delving into this subject again, after he already gave his opinion that we can not comprehend the foreknowledge of God in the preceding chapter. The RiTBa, in defending Maimonides, here falls in an error regarding the RABD, by attributing to him knowledge of Kabalah, an attribute belonging to RABD I. With all the commentaries silent, it is evident that, as far as this defence of the doctorine of self-will versus predestination is concerned, it must be considered weak. The text of this paragraph, however, lends itself to very strong points. The parallelism herein contained is more than of passing strength. Of course, Maimonides establishes the ultimate point upon Faith; but his arguments are chiefly directed to offset contradictions to the Torah. In this he succeeded. The RABD, too, upholds the doctorine of choice of action as against predestination. C.G.) "

31,29,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Numbers 20:8:16,"The word לכן (verse 12) means ""on account of this."" The word also has the connotation of an oath. G'd foresaw how the Israelites would conduct themselves in the land of Israel many years hence. Even Moses himself had predicted this already in Deut. 31,29. Had He allowed Moses and Aaron to build the Temple, He would have had to vent His anger at the people when the time came that they sinned, seeing they had allowed ideal conditions to go to waste. As it is, the people never lived in the Holy Land under ideal conditions so that G'd could use this as a mitigating circumstance when evaluating their sins."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"

It teaches that they were accustomed to being corrupted and returned to their initial corruption. Similarly, it is said, 'And there was that man, Job, great' (Job 1:3). 'ויהי' (And it was) indicates something that they did not have initially, namely, good deeds. Likewise, it is said, 'And there was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim' (1 Samuel 1:1). 'ויהי' (And it was) indicates something that they did not have initially, and here also it indicates something that they did not have initially, as it teaches that they were accustomed to being corrupted and returned to their initial corruption. 'העם' (The people) indicates wicked individuals, as it is stated, 'I have seen this People, and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people' (Exodus 32:9). But when it says 'My people,' 'עמי' (My people) refers to the righteous, as it is stated, 'Send forth My people, and they shall serve Me' (Exodus 7:16).

Likewise, it is said about Samson, 'For he sought an occasion against the Philistines' (Judges 14:4)             Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says that 'met'ananinim' (murmuring) refers to those who mock, as it is stated, 'The words of a mocker are like playful blows' (Proverbs 26:22).

31,29,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 13:1:4,"Although it is a scientific fact that major physical phenomena are reversible, G-d’s ability to destroy earth proves that it had not always existed, that He had created it. Otherwise, whence would G-d have taken the power to destroy it? The fact that the reversals of certain phenomena are the product of G-d’s free will and did not happen of their own, needs to be demonstrated. The verse (Jeremiah 31,10) ""He who disperses Israel will gather it in,"" which might indicate the opposite, when viewed superficially, does in fact not prove that such reversals occur automatically. Jeremiah does not refer to the ingathering as being an automatic corollary of a previous dispersal, but as an act of G-d requiring supernatural means. This is demonstrated clearly by the context of the whole chapter in which this verse appears. Shepherds do likewise with their flocks, and so does the Lord. Sometimes He scatters in order to discipline, sometimes He collects people. All this is due to G-d exercising benevolent Personal Providence. This is true also when such happenings occur as part of the shepherd's vocation. When we talk about natural phenomena, the same does not hold true. Gideon, who wanted to see if the wool which is naturally moisture absorbent could also be made moisture repellant at the will of G-d, had his wish fulfilled (Judges Chapter 6). Thereby the power of G-d to reverse the laws of nature which He Himself had formulated had been demonstrated. Similarly, King Hezzekiah (Kings II, chapter 20). When the king saw the shadow of the sun dial reversing itself, he had found proof of the Creator's ability to reverse the seemingly irreversible processes of nature. The story of the deluge also demonstrates that He who has established natural law can also reverse it. Thereby He proves that His existence had preceded the laws of the universe, else He could not have demonstrated mastery over these laws. G-d therefore is able to decree after the deluge that natural law shall not again cease to function normally. Summer, winter, heat, and cold will all alternate at predictable intervals, as stated in Genesis 8,22. Noach and his sons, having witnessed first a universe which functioned beautifully then a universe in the process of destruction and lastly a newly functioning universe, were the witnesses for all future generations of the truth of the claim that G-d had created the universe ex nihilo. According to the Talmud in Rosh Hashanah 11, the technical method that brought about the flood was the relocation of two stars forming the Pleiades. Even if mankind were to serve G-d, but under the mistaken impression that the laws of nature are immutable, such service of G-d would degenerate if man grew to believe that they were only in touch with intermediaries such as the sun and the moon, and that the Lord Himself would forever unconditionally allow these intermediaries to possess independent power which could not be curbed. At this point, the author engages in polemics against all those Jewish philosophers who, in common with their Greek counterparts, attempt to explain away most of the miracles. He singles out Ralbag especially. He defends the Rambam as having been wilfully misunderstood by some who read his commentary. He ascribes the tendencies of some commentators to rob the story of miracles of their fundamental value to two considerations. 1) No one can perform miracles that outclass those performed by Moses. 2) The beneficiaries of such miracles were not worthy of such far-reaching changes in nature to be performed for their sake. The Talmud Shabbat 53 relates that a husband whose wife died while leaving behind a small baby was in a predicament since he could not afford to hire a wet nurse to nurse the baby. A miracle occurred; the father's nipples produced milk on which the baby fed and survived. Rabbi Joseph views this as an extreme compliment to the father for whose sake such a great miracle was performed. Abaye, on the other hand, feels that it points out the unworthiness of the father, since G-d had to resort to supernatural means to supply the infant's needs. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the father's position was such that a miracle was not denied him, in order for him to fulfil his function of raising the infant. We have to view the role of pious men and prophets at various times in our history in a similar light. On the one hand, the generation of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai and of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, were praised because there was no need for a rainbow to appear during their respective lives (Ketuvot 76). They were praised for the fact that no miracles were needed in their time. No doubt, had the need arisen, these men would have been able to call on the power of miracle to be used on behalf of their contemporaries. Jacob moved a rock meant to be removable only by a whole group of shepherds. On the other hand, when praying for victory against Amalek, Moses’ss hands were so weak they had to be supported. This does not make Jacob superior to Moses. Certain needs arise at certain times. Only at those times can it be determined whether a miracle is in place to meet those needs. Examples are numerous. Joshua's commanding the sun and moon to be arrested in their orbits, does not denigrate the powers of Moses one iota. Had Moses found himself in the same predicament Joshua had found himself in, he would have been able to perform a similar miracle. Even a Yehu, a king of Israel who had failed to remove the golden calves Jerobam had erected, was enabled to wipe out all the priests of the Baal singlehandedly, something none of those greater than he had been able to do. Elijah and Elisha revived the dead, feats not credited to Moses, yet no one puts down Moses’s abilities on account of that. If you will, the revelation at Mount Sinai, and Moses’ss role in it as well as the participation of the entire nation, so outclass and overshadow any miracles performed by anyone subsequently or prior to that, that Moses’ss honor as the prophet/miracleworker par excellence can never be called into question. At that time, Moses had been instrumental in a chidush ha-olam, a renewal of the universe, so to speak. What happened was such a thorough reversal of all natural laws that the work of later prophets pales into relative insignificance by comparison. If this were not so, the miracles predicted in Yoel chapters three and four, would not be capable of being performed without relegating Moses to an inferior position vis a vis the Messiah or whoever will be G-d’s instrument when the time comes to fulfil those prophecies. In fact, all subsequent miracles are ascribed by G-d to Moses, when G-d promises in Exodus 34,10 that all the miraculous acts which are yet to occur are based on what G-d does for, with, and through Moses. In Moses, as it were, rests the fountainhead of all miracles ever performed by any prophet after him. In all of the Torah, we do not find any events which would constitute fulfilment of G-d’s promise to Moses made at that point. Joshua 11,16 makes it clear that throughout his career as leader of the Jewish people, his role remained that of being Moses’ss disciple. Nothing he did is to be understood as being innovative. It may have been Moses’ss desire to personally carry out these miracles as demonstrations of G-d’s power, which prompted him to request permission from G-d to cross the river Jordan. G-d’s denial of this request was coupled with the assurance that indeed his disciple would perform such miracles, thus fulfilling G-d’s promise to Moses in Exodus 34,10. The instructions to Moses to invest Joshua with part of his own glory and Moses’ss subsequent action cause our sages to comment that whosoever leaves behind him pupils fit to take his place has not in fact died at all (Midrash on Numbers 26,20). Our sages have accepted the principle that the Torah occasionally employs language in the manner people do in their every day speech. Therefore, we find both exaggeration and hyperbole. This fact, however, is not sufficient reason to explain away the very miracles that demonstrate the power of the Creator. There is also no foundation for the assumption of some commentators that miracles involving extra terrestrial matters are of inherently greater significance than miracles involving behavior of phenomena that we are familiar with on earth. In fact, one could argue the reverse with at least equal persuasion. If one can change phenomena that occur on earth despite the fact that their celestial causes have NOT been altered, this is more remarkable than changing patterns of behavior by phenomena whose celestial causes have either been neutralised, interfered with, or have been reversed. If, for instance, someone's arm can stay the wheel of a watermill in spite of the fact that the flow and pressure of the stream that activates it has not diminished, this is more remarkable than halting such a wheel by stopping the flow of water to it. If Daniel told Darius that the angel of G-d shut the lions' mouths, this is more remarkable than if the angel had merely killed the lions. We have discussed such events in chapter fifteen, also in chapter thirty-eight, in connection with the Passover in Egypt. The statement in Deut.34,10 that there never arose another prophet comparable to Moses, does not refer to Moses’sd power as a performer of miracles, but to the fact that no one since ever attained the face to face relationship with G-d that the Torah testifies Moses had achieved. The effortlessness with which Moses performed miracles, as compared to the need of other prophets to engage in prayer beforehand etc., proves how much Moses was on G-d’s ""wavelength,"" so to speak.

31,30,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 31:30:1,"את דברי השירה הזאת עד תומם, including 32,36 כי ידין and כי אשא in 32,40, although those verses are not strictly speaking, part of Moses’ warning and testimony."
31,30,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:30:1-2","את דברי השירה הזאת עד תומם, “the words of this song until their conclusion.” This is a reference to the song Haazinu which commences with the next verse. Seeing that Moses referred to his speech as a שירה, “song or poem,” this is the reason that it must always be written and read in the manner one writes and reads a poem. Our sages in the Sifri Haazinu 333 state that some of the greatness of a שירה is that it deals not only with the past and the present but also deals with aspects of the future, the world to come. Tanchuma asks why the שירה which is in the past tense is completely in the feminine gender, whereas the parts referring to the future have been written in the masculine gender? The answer given is that just as a woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth normally repeats the process again and again, so past redemptions and salvations of the Jewish people resulted in renewed exiles. Not so with the redemption of the future which will be absolute, final, not to be followed by any further exiles. This is why the prophet uses the masculine term שיר instead of the feminine term שירה, when he speaks of the future. Compare Isaiah 26,1: ביום ההוא יושר השיר הזה בארץ יהודה, עיר עז לנו ישועה ישית חומות וחל, “on that day, this song shall be sung in the land of Yehudah; “ours is a mighty city; He makes victory our inner and outer wall.” Another verse conveying a similar message is found in Psalms 98,1: שירו לה' שיר חדש כי נפלאות עשה, הושיעה לו ימינו וזרועו קדשו, “Sing to the Lord, a new song, for He has worked wonders; His right hand, His holy arm has won Him victory.”"

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
31,30,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters, Preparing for the Future 2-3","Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior. It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part V; Final Matters 2-8","AS THE FOUR-BOOK-LONG (EXODUS THROUGH Deuteronomy) ACCOUNT OF WANderings and laws draws to a close, there remain several pragmatic provisions for the future that must be attended to. Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping. There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis. This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in II Chron. 36: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: YHWH, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up!"
