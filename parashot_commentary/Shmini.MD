## Leviticus 9

|וַיְהִי֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁמִינִ֔י קָרָ֣א מֹשֶׁ֔ה לְאַהֲרֹ֖ן וּלְבָנָ֑יו וּלְזִקְנֵ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|1|On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut relates the deaths of Nadav and Avihu to their intense love of God, teaching that the closer one brings themselves to God, the more they merit His light without boundaries. Commentary on the eighth day of the installation of the priests highlights ten distinctions, including Aaron's first day as High Priest, sacrifices in the Tabernacle, and the presence of the Shechinah. Kabbalah discusses the attributes of humility and brokenness of heart as vessels for Hashem's G-dliness. The Midrash emphasizes the significance of the eighth day in relation to wisdom, creation, and mourning. Musar interprets the Torah's use of the expression ויהי as signifying a painful experience and discusses Moses' role in the Sanctuary. Quoting commentary, Rashi explains the day of joy in Song of Songs as the eighth day of the Tabernacle's installation, while Ramban expands on the events of that day. The Talmud discusses significant events on the day the Tabernacle was erected and debates the permissibility of making scrolls for children. Targum recounts Moshe calling Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel on the eighth day of their anointing after the Tabernacle was erected. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַח־לְ֠ךָ֠ עֵ֣גֶל בֶּן־בָּקָ֧ר לְחַטָּ֛את וְאַ֥יִל לְעֹלָ֖ה תְּמִימִ֑ם וְהַקְרֵ֖ב לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|2|He said to Aaron: “Take a calf of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and bring them before יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron was commanded to take a bull-calf as a sin-offering for the incident of the golden calf to atone for his peripheral involvement, symbolizing his commitment to his role as a priest. Sin-offerings were brought to atone for specific sins, reminding sinners of their transgressions and deterring them from sinning. The Lower Shekhinah is represented as a calf with a broken neck, while the Higher Shekhinah is symbolized as a cow. Offerings of a cow, bull, and calf were brought to atone for the sin of the golden calf, establishing the priesthood and providing atonement. The Gemara discusses instances of taking and making offerings, noting that they must be from one's own property in cases of inauguration and Yom Kippur. Aaron was instructed to bring a young calf and a ram for offerings to avoid accusations from Satan and create a memorial of righteousness before the Lord. 

|וְאֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל תְּדַבֵּ֣ר לֵאמֹ֑ר קְח֤וּ שְׂעִיר־עִזִּים֙ לְחַטָּ֔את וְעֵ֨גֶל וָכֶ֧בֶשׂ בְּנֵי־שָׁנָ֛ה תְּמִימִ֖ם לְעֹלָֽה׃|3|And speak to the Israelites, saying: Take a he-goat for a sin offering; a calf and a lamb, yearlings without blemish, for a burnt offering;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that the Torah allows mankind to earn God's goodness and achieve closeness to Him, with every person capable of understanding it as a universal inheritance. Commentary discusses the offerings brought by Aaron and the people for atonement, with a focus on their significance in initiating priests and atoning for past sins. Midrash clarifies the distinctions in sacrificial animals and discusses the importance of offerings for forgiveness, while Talmud explores the rules and purposes of offerings, particularly the he-goat sin offering for the New Moon. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations of the offerings, including the significance of the unicorn in expiation. Targum and Tosefta also provide interpretations and clarifications of the sacrificial offerings mentioned in Leviticus. 

|וְשׁ֨וֹר וָאַ֜יִל לִשְׁלָמִ֗ים לִזְבֹּ֙חַ֙ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה וּמִנְחָ֖ה בְּלוּלָ֣ה בַשָּׁ֑מֶן כִּ֣י הַיּ֔וֹם יְהֹוָ֖ה נִרְאָ֥ה אֲלֵיכֶֽם׃|4|and an ox and a ram for an offering of well-being to sacrifice before יהוה; and a meal offering with oil mixed in. For today יהוה will appear to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sacrifices in Leviticus 9:4 are brought as an obligation for the day the Lord will appear unto the people, symbolizing atonement for past deeds and expressing appreciation for God's Presence. Offerings in the Torah are meant to express the desire for closeness with God and must be addressed to Him alone. The Midrash discusses the importance of sacrifices, the consecration of the Tabernacle and priesthood, and the blessings received by those who serve in the name of the Lord. The Altar symbolizes the crown of priesthood and connects earthly sacrifices to the offering of souls by the High Priest Michael in Heaven, linking sanctification of both soul and body. Rashbam explains that God will manifest Himself through the Tabernacle when the celestial fire consumes the offerings on the altar. The Talmud discusses the meal offering of the eighth day of the Tabernacle inauguration and the attire of Moses and Aaron during the High Priesthood. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that sacrifices are to be offered as a peace offering before the Lord, with the Glory of the Lord's Shekinah being revealed. 

|וַיִּקְח֗וּ אֵ֚ת אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוָּ֣ה מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֶל־פְּנֵ֖י אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד וַֽיִּקְרְבוּ֙ כׇּל־הָ֣עֵדָ֔ה וַיַּֽעַמְד֖וּ לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|5|They brought to the front of the Tent of Meeting the things that Moses had commanded, and the community leadership  came forward and stood before יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Or HaChaim explains that Moses commanded, and Aaron carried out the commands for the people, while Malbim distinguishes between different terms related to sacrifices. The congregation approached the Lord joyfully, offering peace offerings and singing praise, with the Divine Presence resting upon them as seen in the giving of the Ten Commandments. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Aaron, his sons, and the congregation following Moses' instructions and presenting offerings before the Tent of Meeting. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֔ה זֶ֧ה הַדָּבָ֛ר אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה תַּעֲשׂ֑וּ וְיֵרָ֥א אֲלֵיכֶ֖ם כְּב֥וֹד יְהֹוָֽה׃|6|Moses said: “This is what יהוה has commanded that you do, that the Presence of יהוה may appear to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes serving Hashem with a unified purpose and aligning actions with His will to reveal His glory, while the Mishna stresses fulfilling the Creator's will and awakening fear of Hashem. The Liturgy describes the priestly garments symbolizing spiritual might, and the Midrash discusses circumcision of the heart to see God's glory and the Divine Presence resting upon the Tabernacle. Quoting Commentary highlights the importance of following God's instructions in sacrifices, and Targum emphasizes the need to remove evil thoughts from the heart to see the Lord's glory [Onkelos Leviticus 9:6; Targum Jonathan on Leviticus 9:6]. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קְרַ֤ב אֶל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֙חַ֙ וַעֲשֵׂ֞ה אֶת־חַטָּֽאתְךָ֙ וְאֶת־עֹ֣לָתֶ֔ךָ וְכַפֵּ֥ר בַּֽעַדְךָ֖ וּבְעַ֣ד הָעָ֑ם וַעֲשֵׂ֞ה אֶת־קׇרְבַּ֤ן הָעָם֙ וְכַפֵּ֣ר בַּֽעֲדָ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָֽה׃|7|Then Moses said to Aaron: “Come forward to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering, making expiation for yourself and for the people; and sacrifice the people’s offering and make expiation for them, as יהוה has commanded.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructs Aaron to approach the altar to offer sin and burnt offerings, with Rashi explaining Aaron's initial hesitation due to the golden calf incident. Aaron atones for himself before the people, with his sacrifice having greater atoning power. The prohibition is not to shave the hair of a scab, and the priest must recognize signs of impurity in the hairs. Moses reassures Aaron of his acceptance into the priesthood, encouraging him to approach the altar with confidence despite initial fear. Aharon performs the offerings as commanded by God, overcoming his initial reluctance with encouragement from Moses. 

|וַיִּקְרַ֥ב אַהֲרֹ֖ן אֶל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חַ וַיִּשְׁחַ֛ט אֶת־עֵ֥גֶל הַחַטָּ֖את אֲשֶׁר־לֽוֹ׃|8|Aaron came forward to the altar and slaughtered his calf of sin offering.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Or HaChaim explains that Aaron's approach to the altar symbolizes his readiness to offer his own soul as a guilt-offering, understanding that the act of slaughtering the animal was an act of mercy by God. Tur HaArokh suggests that Aaron's involvement in the sin of the golden calf troubled him, with Moses reassuring him of God's forgiveness. Or HaChaim further explores the concept of atonement through animal sacrifice, suggesting that the offering serves as a reminder of the sinner's spiritual level and sensitivity to the animal's suffering. Ibn Ezra notes that the sin offering came from Aaron's own property, emphasizing personal responsibility. In the Midrash, Aaron's zeal in approaching the altar and starting with his own offering before presenting the offering of the people is highlighted as atoning for both himself and the people. David expresses gratitude for Naomi and Ruth returning to Bethlehem at midnight, emphasizing the importance of a woman finding a resting place in her husband's house. Ruth's purity is emphasized in her actions following her mother-in-law's instructions. In the Targum, Aaron approaches the altar and slaughters a calf for a sin-offering, showing determination and taking responsibility for his own sin. 

|וַ֠יַּקְרִ֠בוּ בְּנֵ֨י אַהֲרֹ֣ן אֶת־הַדָּם֮ אֵלָיו֒ וַיִּטְבֹּ֤ל אֶצְבָּעוֹ֙ בַּדָּ֔ם וַיִּתֵּ֖ן עַל־קַרְנ֣וֹת הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חַ וְאֶת־הַדָּ֣ם יָצַ֔ק אֶל־יְס֖וֹד הַמִּזְבֵּֽחַ׃|9|Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him; he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; and he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

During the sin offering ritual, the High Priest poured blood on the Altar foundation to achieve atonement for man, symbolizing life and the origins of sin. The blood was presented by Aaron's sons and poured at the base of the altar according to the laws of the sin offering. Only the sin-offering requires the application of blood on the altar with one's finger, as stated in Leviticus 4:6, and the blood must be plentiful enough to dip one's finger into. Rabbi Tarfon argues that the death of Aaron's sons should cause mourning for the whole house of Israel, and Targum describes how Aaron sanctified the altar for atonement by putting blood on the corners and pouring the rest at the base. 

|וְאֶת־הַחֵ֨לֶב וְאֶת־הַכְּלָיֹ֜ת וְאֶת־הַיֹּתֶ֤רֶת מִן־הַכָּבֵד֙ מִן־הַ֣חַטָּ֔את הִקְטִ֖יר הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חָה כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־מֹשֶֽׁה׃|10|The fat, the kidneys, and the protuberance of the liver from the sin offering he turned into smoke on the altar—as יהוה had commanded Moses;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Leviticus 9:10, the fat, kidneys, and lobe of the liver of the sin offering were burned on the altar as commanded by the Lord through Moses, with interpretations from Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Or HaChaim, Ramban, and Targum Onkelos and Jonathan. The Midrash discusses the specific details of which part of the liver is taken in sacrifices, ultimately concluding that part of the liver is taken with the lobe. 

|וְאֶת־הַבָּשָׂ֖ר וְאֶת־הָע֑וֹר שָׂרַ֣ף בָּאֵ֔שׁ מִח֖וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|11|and the flesh and the skin were consumed in fire outside the camp.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sin offering in Leviticus 9:11, including the flesh and hide, was burned outside the camp, a unique practice reserved for specific sin offerings like this one and those related to installation ceremonies, all done by divine command. Unlike regular sin offerings consumed by priests, the flesh of this specific sin offering was burned to sanctify the altar and complete the consecration rites. 

|וַיִּשְׁחַ֖ט אֶת־הָעֹלָ֑ה וַ֠יַּמְצִ֠אוּ בְּנֵ֨י אַהֲרֹ֤ן אֵלָיו֙ אֶת־הַדָּ֔ם וַיִּזְרְקֵ֥הוּ עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֖חַ סָבִֽיב׃|12|Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron’s sons passed the blood to him, and he dashed it against all sides of the altar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains "וימציאו" as presenting, Sforno suggests Aaron's sons trained in priestly functions, Steinsaltz describes the burnt offering process, Ibn Ezra connects "וימציאו" to "matza". Midrash warns against overindulging in wine using Proverbs 23:31, linking Aaron's sons' fate to intoxication. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the slaughtering process in Leviticus 9:12. 

|וְאֶת־הָעֹלָ֗ה הִמְצִ֧יאוּ אֵלָ֛יו לִנְתָחֶ֖יהָ וְאֶת־הָרֹ֑אשׁ וַיַּקְטֵ֖ר עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּֽחַ׃|13|They passed the burnt offering to him in sections, as well as the head, and he turned it into smoke on the altar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The burnt offering was placed on the altar and consumed by heavenly fire after being properly cut into pieces by Aaron's sons (Rashbam, Steinsaltz). The Talmud identifies three specific goats that were sacrificed on the day of the Tabernacle's inauguration (Zevachim). The Targum describes the burnt offering as being presented with its limbs severed and the head, which were then burned on the altar. 

|וַיִּרְחַ֥ץ אֶת־הַקֶּ֖רֶב וְאֶת־הַכְּרָעָ֑יִם וַיַּקְטֵ֥ר עַל־הָעֹלָ֖ה הַמִּזְבֵּֽחָה׃|14|He washed the entrails and the legs, and turned them into smoke on the altar with the burnt offering.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The priest washed the innards and legs of the Olah offering and burned them on the altar, symbolizing the care and precision involved in God taking Israel out of Egypt, Israel's development into a full nation, the wise man's consecration to God, and the importance of following orders and guidance in spiritual growth. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the washing and burning of the innards in the burnt offering. 

|וַיַּקְרֵ֕ב אֵ֖ת קׇרְבַּ֣ן הָעָ֑ם וַיִּקַּ֞ח אֶת־שְׂעִ֤יר הַֽחַטָּאת֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לָעָ֔ם וַיִּשְׁחָטֵ֥הוּ וַֽיְחַטְּאֵ֖הוּ כָּרִאשֽׁוֹן׃|15|Next he brought forward the people’s offering. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering, and slaughtered it, and presented it as a sin offering like the previous one.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Malbim, Ibn Ezra, Steinsaltz, and Midrash explain the significance of Aaron presenting the sin offering for the people in Leviticus 9:15, clarifying the details and order of the offerings. The Tanakh mentions Moses' anger at Eleazar and Ithamar for not following proper procedure in burning the sin offering, while Targum discusses the offering of the goat for sin atonement. 

|וַיַּקְרֵ֖ב אֶת־הָעֹלָ֑ה וַֽיַּעֲשֶׂ֖הָ כַּמִּשְׁפָּֽט׃|16|He brought forward the burnt offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the burnt offering brought as a freewill gift, detailing the procedure done by Aaron's sons, involving sprinkling blood, arranging flesh pieces, and burning them. Rashi explains that the obligatory burnt offering requires laying of hands, as seen in Aaron's burnt offering on the eighth day, following the customary rule detailed in Leviticus 1. The Midrash highlights similarities between burnt-offerings in Leviticus 9:16, involving flaying, cutting, burning by altar fire, blood flinging, and limb return. Ramban explains that people's burnt-offering on the eighth day did not exempt them from the Daily burnt-offering, with the meal-offering being an addition. The Talmud discusses the High Priest's obligatory burnt offering on the eighth day, requiring hand placement like a voluntary burnt offering. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the proper procedure of the burnt offering in Leviticus 9:16. 

|וַיַּקְרֵב֮ אֶת־הַמִּנְחָה֒ וַיְמַלֵּ֤א כַפּוֹ֙ מִמֶּ֔נָּה וַיַּקְטֵ֖ר עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חַ מִלְּבַ֖ד עֹלַ֥ת הַבֹּֽקֶר׃|17|He then brought forward the meal offering and, taking a handful of it, he turned it into smoke on the altar—in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Parshat Tzav, the sin offering precedes the burnt offering to emphasize responding positively to God's light, with the burnt offering symbolizing man's response to the original light. The consecration offerings for Aaron and his sons were in addition to the daily burnt offering, and the meal offering was presented separately. The Mishnah outlines requirements for the meal offering, including proper removal of the handful and absence of foreign particles. The Talmud discusses the removal of the handful with the right hand and the use of oil on the right thumb and toe, while the Tanakh details the daily offerings of lambs with meal offerings. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan depict the priest bringing the meal offering separately from the morning burnt offering. 

|וַיִּשְׁחַ֤ט אֶת־הַשּׁוֹר֙ וְאֶת־הָאַ֔יִל זֶ֥בַח הַשְּׁלָמִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר לָעָ֑ם וַ֠יַּמְצִ֠אוּ בְּנֵ֨י אַהֲרֹ֤ן אֶת־הַדָּם֙ אֵלָ֔יו וַיִּזְרְקֵ֥הוּ עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֖חַ סָבִֽיב׃|18|He slaughtered the ox and the ram, the people’s sacrifice of well-being. Aaron’s sons passed the blood to him—which he dashed against every side of the altar—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno explains that priests perform peace offerings for the congregation, Malbim differentiates between שחט, טבח, and זבח, Steinsaltz describes Aaron slaughtering the bull and ram for peace offerings with his sons assisting. The Halakhah states that blood from burnt-offerings, guilt-offerings, and peace offerings is cast on the altar in a diagonal manner, with the remainder poured on the foundation. The Midrash emphasizes Aaron and his sons' mastery of seven sacrificial services, while the Targum describes the slaughtering of the ox and ram for peace offerings with Aaron's sons presenting the blood for sprinkling. 

|וְאֶת־הַחֲלָבִ֖ים מִן־הַשּׁ֑וֹר וּמִ֨ן־הָאַ֔יִל הָֽאַלְיָ֤ה וְהַֽמְכַסֶּה֙ וְהַכְּלָיֹ֔ת וְיֹתֶ֖רֶת הַכָּבֵֽד׃|19|and the fat parts of the ox and the ram: the broad tail, the covering [fat], the kidneys, and the protuberances of the livers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "hamechaseh" encompasses all fats offered on the altar, including those covering the inwards, kidneys, and loins, with no distinction in function between different types of fat. Priests are instructed to wash their hands and feet to avoid death, a law applicable for all future generations. The specific parts of the ox and ram to be offered as sacrifices, including fats, tail, covering of the innards, kidneys, and lobe of the liver, are mentioned in both Targums on Leviticus 9:19. 

|וַיָּשִׂ֥ימוּ אֶת־הַחֲלָבִ֖ים עַל־הֶחָז֑וֹת וַיַּקְטֵ֥ר הַחֲלָבִ֖ים הַמִּזְבֵּֽחָה׃|20|They laid these fat parts over the breasts; and Aaron  turned the fat parts into smoke on the altar,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash discusses Moses' unique seven blessings for Israel, surpassing earlier generations, with Moses risking his life for Israel to justify his role as the one to bless them. The Talmud explains the positioning of the fat on sacrifices, with the fat placed on top of the breast during the exchange between priests before being burned on the altar. Rashi, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Saadia Gaon debate the interpretation of the fat parts, with Ramban ultimately siding with Saadia Gaon's interpretation that the tail fat is not cheilev. The Tosefta discusses the laws of the sciatic nerve, the prohibition against eating the limb of a live animal, and the consequences of eating the fats of live or consecrated animals. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that the fats were placed on top of the breasts and burned on the altar in Leviticus 9:20. 

|וְאֵ֣ת הֶחָז֗וֹת וְאֵת֙ שׁ֣וֹק הַיָּמִ֔ין הֵנִ֧יף אַהֲרֹ֛ן תְּנוּפָ֖ה לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה מֹשֶֽׁה׃|21|and elevated the breasts and the right thighs as an elevation offering before יהוה —as Moses had commanded.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the waving of the breast and right thigh as a wave offering before the Lord, symbolizing dedication to God and acknowledging Him as the source of blessings. Aaron and his sons mastered seven sacrificial services in a short time, including peace offerings brought by the people. Ramban explains that the breast was waved with the fat, but not the thigh, and the priest placed the fats, breast, and thigh on the hand of the offering owner to wave them together. Israelites fulfill their obligation through vow offerings, freewill offerings, and tithed animals, while Kohanim fulfill their obligation through sin-offerings, guilt offerings, first-born livestock, and breast and thigh from peace offerings. 

|וַיִּשָּׂ֨א אַהֲרֹ֧ן אֶת־יָדָ֛ו אֶל־הָעָ֖ם וַֽיְבָרְכֵ֑ם וַיֵּ֗רֶד מֵעֲשֹׂ֧ת הַֽחַטָּ֛את וְהָעֹלָ֖ה וְהַשְּׁלָמִֽים׃|22|Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he stepped down after offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the offering of well-being.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Cain's sin stemming from jealousy towards Hevel's pure sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of pure intentions in serving God. Halakhah outlines the obligations for Kohanim in reciting the priestly blessing with raised hands after sacrifices, facing the congregation. Liturgy explains the recitation of the priestly blessing in the Shemoneh Esrei prayer and the importance of the blessing given by Aaron after completing the Temple Service. Midrash explores the rules and requirements for the Priestly Blessing, while Mishnah details the differences in reciting the blessing in the Temple versus outside. Quoting Commentary highlights interpretations by Ramban, Radak, Rabbeinu Bahya, Magen Avraham, and Ibn Ezra regarding the priestly blessing. Talmud discusses the recitation of the Priestly Benediction with lifted hands following Aaron's example, and the specific practices for the High Priest. Targum mentions Aharon blessing the people after offering various sacrifices with joy. 

|וַיָּבֹ֨א מֹשֶׁ֤ה וְאַהֲרֹן֙ אֶל־אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֔ד וַיֵּ֣צְא֔וּ וַֽיְבָרְכ֖וּ אֶת־הָעָ֑ם וַיֵּרָ֥א כְבוֹד־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־כׇּל־הָעָֽם׃|23|Moses and Aaron then went inside the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the Presence of יהוה appeared to all the people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Leviticus 10:1-3, Aaron's sons were accused of being drunk, possibly due to a lack of Shechinah during consecration rites. Serving God should be done for pleasure, not rewards in the afterlife, which are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. The priestly blessing should be recited in specific ways, and the incense-offering serves as a bridge between realms. The erection of the Tabernacle had significant firsts, and the psalmist prays for God's favor and success. Moses and Aaron bless the people, and the Shekinah's glory appears, highlighting the importance of unity and partnership in working together. 

|וַתֵּ֤צֵא אֵשׁ֙ מִלִּפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה וַתֹּ֙אכַל֙ עַל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ אֶת־הָעֹלָ֖ה וְאֶת־הַחֲלָבִ֑ים וַיַּ֤רְא כׇּל־הָעָם֙ וַיָּרֹ֔נּוּ וַֽיִּפְּל֖וּ עַל־פְּנֵיהֶֽם׃|24|Fire came forth from before יהוה and consumed the burnt offering and the fat parts on the altar. And all the people saw, and shouted, and fell on their faces.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The fire consuming offerings in Leviticus 9:24 signifies God's acceptance and presence, with heavenly fire representing both approval and anger. The perpetual fire on the altar is a mitzvah with specific components, while the first day of Nissan holds significance in consecration and the priesthood. The fire symbolizes the continuation of existence through service to God, connecting to the story of Creation. The consequences faced by Nadav and Avihu for improper procedures highlight the importance of a purified system in worship. Fire descending from heaven is seen in various instances, demonstrating divine power and leading to praise of God.

## Leviticus 10

|וַיִּקְח֣וּ בְנֵֽי־אַ֠הֲרֹ֠ן נָדָ֨ב וַאֲבִיה֜וּא אִ֣ישׁ מַחְתָּת֗וֹ וַיִּתְּנ֤וּ בָהֵן֙ אֵ֔שׁ וַיָּשִׂ֥ימוּ עָלֶ֖יהָ קְטֹ֑רֶת וַיַּקְרִ֜יבוּ לִפְנֵ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֵ֣שׁ זָרָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֧ר לֹ֦א צִוָּ֖ה אֹתָֽם׃|1|Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his fire pan, put fire in it, and laid incense on it; and they offered before יהוה alien fire, which had not been enjoined upon them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nadav and Avihu sinned by offering unauthorized incense with a strange fire on the altar, lacking unity and faith in God's commandments, leading to their punishment of being consumed by heavenly fire. The prohibition against yida’aoni involves using a bone of a bird named yido’a for rituals related to epilepsy and predictions, with laws further elucidated in Sanhedrin. The death of Nadav and Avihu is attributed to their failure to consult with Aaron or Moses before offering a strange fire, seen as an atonement for their sins. Aaron's sons died for offering alien fire before יהוה, with Eleazar and Ithamar serving as priests during Aaron's lifetime. Nadab and Abihu offered unauthorized fire using their own censers and incense, resulting in their punishment of being consumed by a fire from the Lord. 

|וַתֵּ֥צֵא אֵ֛שׁ מִלִּפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה וַתֹּ֣אכַל אוֹתָ֑ם וַיָּמֻ֖תוּ לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|2|And fire came forth from יהוה and consumed them; thus they died at the instance of  יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nadab and Abihu died for offering strange fire before the Eternal, seen as a divine punishment that left their bodies intact, serving as atonement for their sin. The deaths were a result of acting out of custom rather than following divine requirements, leading to their punishment by divine fire. The deaths were twofold, one due to offering strange fire and the other because they left no children. The phrase "It was [vayhi]" in the Bible can signify both trouble and joy. Moses sanctified Aaron and his sons by offering them as sacrifices to God, while Nadab and Abihu's presumption to teach a religious ruling in the presence of their teachers led to their tragic demise. Aaron's sons failed to understand their roles as priests and the importance of following divine commands without making changes. The deaths of Nadav and Avihu were considered a calamity, as their bodies remained intact despite being burned with fire. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן הוּא֩ אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֤ה ׀ לֵאמֹר֙ בִּקְרֹבַ֣י אֶקָּדֵ֔שׁ וְעַל־פְּנֵ֥י כׇל־הָעָ֖ם אֶכָּבֵ֑ד וַיִּדֹּ֖ם אַהֲרֹֽן׃|3|Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what יהוה meant by saying:  Through those near to Me I show Myself holy,  And gain glory before all the people.”  And Aaron was silent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God advises Moses that the Jewish people can seek forgiveness by emulating His example, promising to forgive their sins due to their creation being the reason for the universe. The incident with Nadav and Avihu demonstrates God's sanctity through those close to Him, holding them to a higher standard. Aaron's silence upon hearing this decree signifies acceptance and understanding, emphasizing the importance of humility and submission to divine justice. The priests Nadab and Abihu died to receive an incorruptible life, symbolizing immortality and sanctification for those near God. Aaron's silence after their deaths reflects acceptance of God's judgment, leading to his sanctification. The concept of holiness is related to a person's presence and existence, demonstrating the significance of humility and acceptance of divine decree in times of difficulty. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֣א מֹשֶׁ֗ה אֶל־מִֽישָׁאֵל֙ וְאֶ֣ל אֶלְצָפָ֔ן בְּנֵ֥י עֻזִּיאֵ֖ל דֹּ֣ד אַהֲרֹ֑ן וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם קִ֞֠רְב֞֠וּ שְׂא֤וּ אֶת־אֲחֵיכֶם֙ מֵאֵ֣ת פְּנֵי־הַקֹּ֔דֶשׁ אֶל־מִח֖וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|4|Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come forward and carry your kinsmen away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Different opinions exist on whether Nadab and Abihu died inside or outside the Sanctuary, with Mishael and Elzaphan tasked with removing their bodies to avoid defiling the priests. The Divine Presence rests on the Ark at Aaron's command, and the High Priest's Yom Kippur prayer includes requests for blessings. The Pesach Sheni is linked to the camp of Israel as a metaphor for the soul of the Jewish people. Rashbam explains the significance of various Torah narratives involving the sons of Amram, Yitzhar, and Uzziel. Rabbi Akiva identifies Mishael and Elzaphan as the ones carrying the bodies of Nadab and Abihu, while Rabbi Yitzchak disagrees, suggesting they could have been purified if they were carrying Joseph's coffin. 

|וַֽיִּקְרְב֗וּ וַיִּשָּׂאֻם֙ בְּכֻתֳּנֹתָ֔ם אֶל־מִח֖וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֑ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר מֹשֶֽׁה׃|5|They came forward and carried them out of the camp by their tunics, as Moses had ordered.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The bodies of Nadav and Avihu were burnt internally by fire, leaving their clothing and bodies unharmed, with their holy vestments becoming ritually impure and not removed before being carried outside the camp. Jephthah's lack of Torah knowledge led to the tragic sacrifice of his daughter, contrasting with other biblical figures who made vows without sacrificing their children. The deaths of Nadav and Avihu were due to their deep involvement in mystical matters, leading them close to God to the point where their bodies could not keep up, believed to sanctify God and be reincarnations of Adam's soul. The sons of Aaron were carried beyond the encampment in their tunics by their cousins, as instructed by Moses, and buried with iron hooks in their garments. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֣ה אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֡ן וּלְאֶלְעָזָר֩ וּלְאִֽיתָמָ֨ר ׀ בָּנָ֜יו רָֽאשֵׁיכֶ֥ם אַל־תִּפְרָ֣עוּ ׀ וּבִגְדֵיכֶ֤ם לֹֽא־תִפְרֹ֙מוּ֙ וְלֹ֣א תָמֻ֔תוּ וְעַ֥ל כׇּל־הָעֵדָ֖ה יִקְצֹ֑ף וַאֲחֵיכֶם֙ כׇּל־בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל יִבְכּוּ֙ אֶת־הַשְּׂרֵפָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר שָׂרַ֥ף יְהֹוָֽה׃|6|And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not bare your heads  and do not rend your clothes, lest you die and anger strike the whole community. But your kin,  all the house of Israel, shall bewail the burning that יהוה has wrought.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructed Aaron and his sons not to mourn Nadav and Avihu by growing their hair long or tearing their garments, as this would disturb God's joy. The priests were forbidden from these practices, but the rest of Israel was commanded to weep during the funeral and burial, with even women participating in mourning. The deaths of Nadav and Avihu atoned for Israel, and they are highly acclaimed. The Mishnah discusses execution by burning, emphasizing the importance of proper procedure. Priests are forbidden from tearing their garments as a sign of honor and dignity, reflecting how we should treat our bodies as the garment of the soul. The Talmud discusses mourning laws and divine punishment for failing to observe them, while the Tanakh and Targum provide additional context and instructions for mourning and lamentation. 

|וּמִפֶּ֩תַח֩ אֹ֨הֶל מוֹעֵ֜ד לֹ֤א תֵֽצְאוּ֙ פֶּן־תָּמֻ֔תוּ כִּי־שֶׁ֛מֶן מִשְׁחַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה עֲלֵיכֶ֑ם וַֽיַּעֲשׂ֖וּ כִּדְבַ֥ר מֹשֶֽׁה׃|7|And so do not go outside the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die, for יהוה’s anointing oil is upon you.” And they did as Moses had bidden.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anointing oil consecrates priests like Aaron and his sons for service in the Tabernacle, forbidding them from leaving the Temple during service under the consequence of death. Mourning rituals for priests are derived from various sources, emphasizing the importance of observing them. In matters of greatness, one should begin with the most important member of a group, while in matters involving a curse, the least important member should be addressed first. The Targum emphasizes the obedience of individuals to instructions regarding staying in the Tent of Meeting after anointing. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר יְהֹוָ֔ה אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֖ן לֵאמֹֽר׃|8|And יהוה spoke to Aaron, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of serving God without personal gain, with no mention of rewards in the afterlife for keeping commandments. Malbim explains the severity of the warning against drinking wine in the context of entering the tent of meeting, with Ibn Ezra and Chizkuni linking it to preventing a fate similar to Aaron's sons. Jewish Thought stresses the interconnectedness of impurity and holiness, the importance of following religious laws to avoid heterodoxy, and the necessity of following legal deductions and religious zeal to prevent schism within the community. Kabbalah questions how Yitzchak could mistakenly bless Esav over Yaakov, emphasizing that blessings should be preceded by prayer. Midrash discusses the joy of consuming God's words, the sanctification of the House of God through Aaron's sons, and the dangers of wine, linking it to boils, sores, and shame. Quoting Commentary highlights the warning against desecrating consecrated grounds after the death of Aaron's sons, the role of priests in maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle, and the prohibition of priests being intoxicated when performing sacrificial offerings. The Talmud emphasizes the importance of priests being sober when serving in the Tabernacle, referencing specific sections from Leviticus and Numbers, with Rabbi Simai suggesting that priests can learn from their own traditions about the prohibition of drinking wine before entering the Sanctuary. Both Targums state that God spoke to Aharon. 

|יַ֣יִן וְשֵׁכָ֞ר אַל־תֵּ֣שְׁתְּ ׀ אַתָּ֣ה ׀ וּבָנֶ֣יךָ אִתָּ֗ךְ בְּבֹאֲכֶ֛ם אֶל־אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵ֖ד וְלֹ֣א תָמֻ֑תוּ חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָ֖ם לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|9|Drink no wine or other intoxicant, you or your sons, when you enter the Tent of Meeting, that you may not die. This is a law for all time throughout the ages,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against priests drinking wine and strong drink in the Tent of Meeting is to prevent intoxication and maintain clarity of mind when performing sacred duties, with specific consequences for violating this commandment. Intoxicated individuals are forbidden from entering the Temple or rendering halachic decisions, and priests who drink wine are prohibited from approaching the Altar or reciting the priestly blessing in certain services. The negative effects of alcohol on individuals and society are discussed in Jewish thought, emphasizing the importance of self-discipline and faith in God to avoid sin and heresy. The Mishnah outlines the prohibitions for a nazirite regarding consuming products from the vine and the specific quantities that determine liability for violating these prohibitions. The sages attribute the deaths of Nadav and Avihu to entering the Sanctuary intoxicated, highlighting the dangers of drinking alcohol before sacred duties. The Talmud further elaborates on the prohibition of priests drinking wine or strong drink before entering the Temple, discussing specific quantities, consequences, and definitions related to intoxication. 

|וּֽלְהַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין הַקֹּ֖דֶשׁ וּבֵ֣ין הַחֹ֑ל וּבֵ֥ין הַטָּמֵ֖א וּבֵ֥ין הַטָּהֽוֹר׃|10|for you must distinguish between the sacred and the profane, and between the impure and the pure;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The flow of life-force from the heart is crucial for the health of the body, priests must distinguish between the holy and the profane, only certain types of scales on fish are considered kosher, intoxication disqualifies priests from Temple service, and priests must maintain purity to uphold holiness in the Sanctuary. 

|וּלְהוֹרֹ֖ת אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל אֵ֚ת כׇּל־הַ֣חֻקִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אֲלֵיהֶ֖ם בְּיַד־מֹשֶֽׁה׃|11|and you must teach the Israelites all the laws which יהוה has imparted to them through Moses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the symbolism of priests merging son and disciple, while the commentary emphasizes the prohibition of priests ministering while intoxicated. Halakhah prohibits praying while drunk, and the Talmud explores the use of wine in religious contexts. Tanakh emphasizes speaking proper rulings, and Targum highlights the importance of teaching the statutes to the children of Israel. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן וְאֶ֣ל אֶ֠לְעָזָ֠ר וְאֶל־אִ֨יתָמָ֥ר ׀ בָּנָיו֮ הַנּֽוֹתָרִים֒ קְח֣וּ אֶת־הַמִּנְחָ֗ה הַנּוֹתֶ֙רֶת֙ מֵאִשֵּׁ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה וְאִכְל֥וּהָ מַצּ֖וֹת אֵ֣צֶל הַמִּזְבֵּ֑חַ כִּ֛י קֹ֥דֶשׁ קׇֽדָשִׁ֖ים הִֽוא׃|12|Moses spoke to Aaron and to his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: Take the meal offering that is left over from יהוה’s offerings by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that priests in mourning could still eat the meal offering, while Rabbeinu Bahya stresses the importance of comforting the bereaved. Siftei Chakhamim attributes Nadav and Avihu's deaths to specific actions, Ibn Ezra notes only the holy can eat the meal offering, and Chizkuni clarifies where it should be eaten. Halakhah prohibits eating sacrificial meat when the altar is damaged, Midrash discusses Moses' sons and the importance of following rituals, and Or HaChaim and Ramban delve into the significance of specific words. The Talmud debates the permissibility of eating a boiled meal offering and the merit of the righteous protecting their descendants, while Tanakh shows Moses interceding for Aaron. Targum details Moses instructing Aaron and his sons to eat the remaining meal offering unleavened beside the altar. 

|וַאֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם אֹתָהּ֙ בְּמָק֣וֹם קָד֔וֹשׁ כִּ֣י חׇקְךָ֤ וְחׇק־בָּנֶ֙יךָ֙ הִ֔וא מֵאִשֵּׁ֖י יְהֹוָ֑ה כִּי־כֵ֖ן צֻוֵּֽיתִי׃|13|You shall eat it in the sacred precinct, inasmuch as it is your due, and that of your sons, from יהוה’s offerings by fire; for so I have been commanded.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses free will and consequences, King Achav's judgment, the importance of Tishrey, and Israel's livelihood determined by God. Daughters do not have a portion in holy meal-offerings, laws on eating meal offerings apply in mourning, "sons of Israel" includes males, meal offerings must be eaten in a holy place, and "both" excludes certain offerings from priests' allotment. Following God's commands in eating offerings, even in mourning, is emphasized, clarifying that daughters do not have a portion in certain rituals. The introduction of "זאת חקת התורה" signifies the fixed nature of laws being presented. Abaye explains meal offerings must be eaten in a sacred place, Moses instructs Aaron and his sons to partake in offerings during mourning, and repetition in Leviticus teaches offerings must be eaten as commanded by God. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that fire-offerings are to be eaten in a sacred place as designated for priests and families. 

|וְאֵת֩ חֲזֵ֨ה הַתְּנוּפָ֜ה וְאֵ֣ת ׀ שׁ֣וֹק הַתְּרוּמָ֗ה תֹּֽאכְלוּ֙ בְּמָק֣וֹם טָה֔וֹר אַתָּ֕ה וּבָנֶ֥יךָ וּבְנֹתֶ֖יךָ אִתָּ֑ךְ כִּֽי־חׇקְךָ֤ וְחׇק־בָּנֶ֙יךָ֙ נִתְּנ֔וּ מִזִּבְחֵ֥י שַׁלְמֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|14|But the breast of elevation offering and the thigh of gift offering you [and your wife], and your sons and daughters with you, may eat in any pure place, for they have been assigned as a due to you and your sons from the Israelites’ sacrifices of well-being.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the wave breast of peace offerings should be eaten in a clean place within the camp of Israel, with sons having a claim to a portion but not daughters. Rabbeinu Bahya notes that both men and women can eat the breast and thigh in a ritually pure place, and Ibn Ezra emphasizes that males and females can partake as long as they are clean. The firstborn offering and portions of sacrificial meat can be eaten by specific groups in Jerusalem, while a chalalah is prohibited from consuming consecrated foods. In the Midrash, it is emphasized that certain offerings should be eaten in Jerusalem, with daughters not having a portion, and in the Talmud, it is stated that daughters of priests can only eat certain gifts while living in the priest's household. The Targum highlights that the breast and thigh can be eaten by priests and their families as their portion from the peace offerings of the Israelites. 

|שׁ֣וֹק הַתְּרוּמָ֞ה וַחֲזֵ֣ה הַתְּנוּפָ֗ה עַ֣ל אִשֵּׁ֤י הַחֲלָבִים֙ יָבִ֔יאוּ לְהָנִ֥יף תְּנוּפָ֖ה לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וְהָיָ֨ה לְךָ֜ וּלְבָנֶ֤יךָ אִתְּךָ֙ לְחׇק־עוֹלָ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָֽה׃|15|Together with the fat of fire offering, they must present the thigh of gift offering and the breast of elevation offering, which are to be elevated as an elevation offering before יהוה, and which are to be your due and that of your sons with you for all time—as יהוה has commanded.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The thigh and breast offerings were waved and heaved differently during the consecration of priests, with the thigh being a heave-offering to God and the breast being waved for Moses. The fat portions were beneath during the waving, and these offerings could not be claimed until after the waving. The importance of following God's commands regarding the consumption of offerings, even during times of mourning, is emphasized, along with specific instructions regarding the placement of fats in the fire offerings. Certain items, such as the log of oil with the guilt offering of a recovered leper, first fruits, and sacrificial portions of peace offerings, require waving but not bringing near to the altar. The repetition of phrases in Leviticus highlights the importance of following God's commands, even in times of mourning. 

|וְאֵ֣ת ׀ שְׂעִ֣יר הַֽחַטָּ֗את דָּרֹ֥שׁ דָּרַ֛שׁ מֹשֶׁ֖ה וְהִנֵּ֣ה שֹׂרָ֑ף וַ֠יִּקְצֹ֠ף עַל־אֶלְעָזָ֤ר וְעַל־אִֽיתָמָר֙ בְּנֵ֣י אַהֲרֹ֔ן הַנּוֹתָרִ֖ם לֵאמֹֽר׃|16|Then Moses inquired about the goat of sin offering, and it had already been burned! He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and said,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the death of Nadav and Avihu in relation to their desire for the refined truth of God's conduct, highlighting the importance of sacrifices for future generations. Commentary explains Moses' inquiry about the sin offering for the New Moon and the differing opinions on the law regarding mourners and the consumption of offerings. Midrash reflects on Moses' mistakes due to anger and the importance of following God's commandments, while Musar emphasizes the lesson of avoiding errors caused by anger. Quoting Commentary and Second Temple further illustrate instances of Moses' errors due to anger and the difficulty of repentance for the wise. Talmud discusses various topics related to offerings, righteous descendants, and intermarriage, while Tanakh and Targum provide specific references to the offerings brought for sin. 

|מַדּ֗וּעַ לֹֽא־אֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם אֶת־הַחַטָּאת֙ בִּמְק֣וֹם הַקֹּ֔דֶשׁ כִּ֛י קֹ֥דֶשׁ קׇֽדָשִׁ֖ים הִ֑וא וְאֹתָ֣הּ ׀ נָתַ֣ן לָכֶ֗ם לָשֵׂאת֙ אֶת־עֲוֺ֣ן הָעֵדָ֔ה לְכַפֵּ֥ר עֲלֵיהֶ֖ם לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|17|“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sacred area? For it is most holy, and it is what was given to you to remove the guilt of the community and to make expiation for them before יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi questions why the priests did not eat the sin offering in the holy place, emphasizing the importance of consuming it for atonement. Halakhah states that priests must eat consecrated sin-offerings and guilt-offerings within specific time restrictions, while Midrash highlights the significance of eating the sin-offering for atonement of the congregation. Musar uses Moses' mistakes due to anger as a lesson, and the Talmud explores various aspects of sin offerings and their atonement. The Targum commentary emphasizes the holiness and purpose of the sin-offering for atonement. 

|הֵ֚ן לֹא־הוּבָ֣א אֶת־דָּמָ֔הּ אֶל־הַקֹּ֖דֶשׁ פְּנִ֑ימָה אָכ֨וֹל תֹּאכְל֥וּ אֹתָ֛הּ בַּקֹּ֖דֶשׁ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוֵּֽיתִי׃|18|Since its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary,  you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Malbim, and Ibn Ezra discuss the requirements for eating a sin offering if the blood is not brought into the sanctuary. The Midrash explains that unfit offerings should be burned before the Temple, emphasizing the importance of following God's commands. The Mishnah details differing opinions on the status of sin offering blood if disqualified, with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and the Rabbis disagreeing on its presentation. The Talmud debates burning a sin offering if its blood enters the Sanctuary, and the Tanakh outlines the procedures for sin offerings by the anointed priest and community leadership. The Targum emphasizes the importance of following commandments regarding the consumption of sin offerings. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר אַהֲרֹ֜ן אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה הֵ֣ן הַ֠יּ֠וֹם הִקְרִ֨יבוּ אֶת־חַטָּאתָ֤ם וְאֶת־עֹֽלָתָם֙ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה וַתִּקְרֶ֥אנָה אֹתִ֖י כָּאֵ֑לֶּה וְאָכַ֤לְתִּי חַטָּאת֙ הַיּ֔וֹם הַיִּיטַ֖ב בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|19|And Aaron spoke to Moses, “See, this day they brought their sin offering and their burnt offering before יהוה, and such things have befallen me! Had I eaten sin offering today, would יהוה have approved?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron, as the High Priest, clarified to Moses that he was permitted to offer sacrifices while mourning, but not to eat sacrificial food. Moses questioned if the sin-offering was burnt due to mourning, but Aaron explained that all offerings were completed before his sons' death. The prohibition against eating second tithe in bereavement is derived from Torah law, with mourning for close relatives being a positive commandment. Moses pleaded for forgiveness after punishing the Jews for worshipping the golden calf, emphasizing loyalty to God. Rabbi Neḥemya and the Sages agree that Aaron was correct in not partaking of the sin offering while mourning, with Aaron's wisdom in not interrupting Moses highlighted. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע מֹשֶׁ֔ה וַיִּיטַ֖ב בְּעֵינָֽיו׃|20|And when Moses heard this, he approved.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moshe was puzzled by Aharon's decision not to eat the goat offering of the new moon, but later understood its connection to the atonement for the reduction in size of the moon. Moses admitted his error and accepted Aaron's interpretation, praising Aaron and his sons for their behavior. The obligation to mourn for close relatives is a positive commandment, with additional mourning days instituted by Moses. Rabbi Pinhas and Rabbi Yirmeya discuss how Moses forgot halakha when angry, with Aaron correcting him and Moses admitting his mistake. The sacrificial cult in Leviticus is explored for its role in maintaining the covenant between God and Israel. Gemara discusses Moses acknowledging Aaron's argument and the importance of not speaking before someone greater in wisdom. Aaron questioned eating the sin offering after a tragedy, and Moses approved of his decision. Moshe heard and approved of Aharon's reminder of the ritual.

## Leviticus 11

|וַיְדַבֵּ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְאֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֖ן לֵאמֹ֥ר אֲלֵהֶֽם׃|1|יהוה spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the connection between Bnei Yisrael and divine will through actions aligned with Torah, emphasizing sanctification and the influence of ingesting animal blood on character. Commentary highlights the importance of Leviticus 11 laws for both Israelites and priests, aiming to educate on purity and impurity distinctions. Halakhah discusses interpretations of kashrut laws, including physical health considerations, while Midrash delves into Moses' mistakes in teaching, divine revelation, and teachings related to biblical figures. Quoting Commentary cites Chizkuni on God instructing individuals to relay messages, and Tanakh lists permitted animals for consumption. Targum emphasizes instructions to eat in purity and avoid specific unclean foods. 

|דַּבְּר֛וּ אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֵאמֹ֑ר זֹ֤את הַֽחַיָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֹּאכְל֔וּ מִכׇּל־הַבְּהֵמָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|2|Speak to the Israelite people thus: These are the creatures that you may eat from among all the land animals:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the unique connection Bnei Yisrael have with Hashem through dietary laws and mitzvot, purifying nature and elevating creation. Halakhah details the specific requirements for animals to be considered kosher, with a prohibition against cannibalism inferred from biblical texts. Jewish Thought explains the purpose of commandments in refining individuals, while Midrash discusses the purification of Israel through specific dietary laws. Musar explores the spiritual impact of consuming different animals for the Israelites, contrasting it with Gentiles. Quoting Commentary details the events surrounding the completion of the Tabernacle and the initiation of the priests, aligning with differing opinions. The Talmud debates the permissibility of eating animals in danger of imminent death, while Tanakh instructs the separation of pure and impure animals. Targum provides interpretations of the Torah regarding permissible animals for the Israelites to eat. 

|כֹּ֣ל ׀ מַפְרֶ֣סֶת פַּרְסָ֗ה וְשֹׁסַ֤עַת שֶׁ֙סַע֙ פְּרָסֹ֔ת מַעֲלַ֥ת גֵּרָ֖ה בַּבְּהֵמָ֑ה אֹתָ֖הּ תֹּאכֵֽלוּ׃|3|any animal that has true hoofs, with clefts through the hoofs, and that chews  the cud—such you may eat.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The laws of kosher animals are outlined in Leviticus 11, with specific criteria such as split hooves and chewing the cud. There is a debate about the permissibility of consuming a fetus found inside a slaughtered animal, and different opinions on what makes an animal kosher are discussed in the Talmud and Tosefta. The Mishnah also explains that fish with fins and scales are considered kosher, while the Midrash clarifies conditions for eating a fetus found in a slaughtered animal. Ramban explains the laws of impurity from touching unclean animals in Leviticus 11:24-28, and the Tosefta details additional criteria for identifying clean and unclean birds. 

|אַ֤ךְ אֶת־זֶה֙ לֹ֣א תֹֽאכְל֔וּ מִֽמַּעֲלֵי֙ הַגֵּרָ֔ה וּמִמַּפְרִסֵ֖י הַפַּרְסָ֑ה אֶֽת־הַ֠גָּמָ֠ל כִּֽי־מַעֲלֵ֨ה גֵרָ֜ה ה֗וּא וּפַרְסָה֙ אֵינֶ֣נּוּ מַפְרִ֔יס טָמֵ֥א ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|4|The following, however, of those that either chew the cud or have true hoofs, you shall not eat: the camel—although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits the consumption of non-kosher animals based on specific characteristics such as split hooves and chewing cud, with these traits symbolizing deeper spiritual and ethical concepts related to purity and holiness. The Midrash connects different exiles of the Jewish people to various animals mentioned in Leviticus 11, with the absence of a specific phrase in the description of the pig representing the exile under the Romans. The Talmud discusses the kashrut laws regarding camels, emphasizing that only the camel itself is impure, not its milk, and exploring the prohibition of consuming offspring from kosher animals that resemble non-kosher animals. 

|וְאֶת־הַשָּׁפָ֗ן כִּֽי־מַעֲלֵ֤ה גֵרָה֙ ה֔וּא וּפַרְסָ֖ה לֹ֣א יַפְרִ֑יס טָמֵ֥א ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|5|the daman—although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rav Hirsch and Steinsaltz explain that the hyrax and hare are not kosher due to their hoof structure. The prohibition against impure animals is derived from Leviticus 11:4-7, with a positive commandment to eat animals that chew their cud and have split hooves. The Midrash discusses empires represented by animals, with Rome associated with emptiness. Prophets saw kingdoms in their actions, with Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom representing different nations. The Torah emphasizes sustaining offspring from every species. The Targum states that the rabbit and coney are unclean for not having a cloven hoof despite chewing their cud. 

|וְאֶת־הָאַרְנֶ֗בֶת כִּֽי־מַעֲלַ֤ת גֵּרָה֙ הִ֔וא וּפַרְסָ֖ה לֹ֣א הִפְרִ֑יסָה טְמֵאָ֥ה הִ֖וא לָכֶֽם׃|6|the hare—although it chews the cud, it has no true hoofs: it is impure for you;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Certain animals in Hebrew have names that do not match their gender, reflecting the dominant aspect of the species, with impure species associated with negative emanations. The criteria for determining kosher animals are based on split hoofs and chewing the cud, with the absence of upper incisors and canines used to identify ruminants. The Midrash associates Babylon, Persia, and Greece with specific animals, while Rome is represented by the pig. The prophets saw kingdoms in their activities, with changes made to the Torah for King Ptolemy to avoid offense. The hare is considered impure for not having split hooves, according to Deuteronomy 14:7. 

|וְאֶת־הַ֠חֲזִ֠יר כִּֽי־מַפְרִ֨יס פַּרְסָ֜ה ה֗וּא וְשֹׁסַ֥ע שֶׁ֙סַע֙ פַּרְסָ֔ה וְה֖וּא גֵּרָ֣ה לֹֽא־יִגָּ֑ר טָמֵ֥א ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|7|and the swine—although it has true hoofs, with the hoofs cleft through, it does not chew the cud: it is impure for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits the consumption of pigs due to their failure to chew the cud and split hooves, with the potential for pigs to become kosher if they evolve into ruminants. Various commentators discuss the possibility of a kosher pig in the future, while Midrash and Jewish Thought associate the pig with Rome and spiritual emptiness. Mishnah addresses ineffective vows, while Musar highlights the spiritual purity of Esau despite negative associations. The Talmud discusses the impurity of certain non-kosher animals, with Rabbi Shimon noting exceptions like the pig. Tanakh and Targum reiterate the impurity of pigs due to their physical characteristics. 

|מִבְּשָׂרָם֙ לֹ֣א תֹאכֵ֔לוּ וּבְנִבְלָתָ֖ם לֹ֣א תִגָּ֑עוּ טְמֵאִ֥ים הֵ֖ם לָכֶֽם׃|8|You shall not eat of their flesh or touch their carcasses; they are impure for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses prohibitions against consuming and touching carcasses of unclean animals, with specific rules regarding distinguishing marks, ritual impurity, and combining unclean animals. Different commentaries and sources highlight the literal interpretation of Torah laws, the consequences of violating prohibitions, and the significance of maintaining holiness and purity. The Talmud discusses guilt scenarios for eating limbs from kosher and non-kosher animals, while Tanakh and Targum emphasize the specific criteria for permissible animals and the prohibition against consuming or touching unclean animals. 

|אֶת־זֶה֙ תֹּֽאכְל֔וּ מִכֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּמָּ֑יִם כֹּ֣ל אֲשֶׁר־לוֹ֩ סְנַפִּ֨יר וְקַשְׂקֶ֜שֶׂת בַּמַּ֗יִם בַּיַּמִּ֛ים וּבַנְּחָלִ֖ים אֹתָ֥ם תֹּאכֵֽלוּ׃|9|These you may eat of all that live in water: anything in water, whether in the seas or in the streams, that has fins and scales—these you may eat.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut advises against eating the tench fish despite having fins and scales due to its ability to survive outside of water. Halakhah discusses the laws regarding identifying kosher fish and the importance of checking for fins and scales. The Midrash explores dietary laws regarding fish and the significance of the number eighteen. The Mishnah states that fish with scales always have fins, while some fish with fins do not have scales. The Talmud discusses the criteria for determining kosher fish and animals based on fins and scales, as well as the permissibility of drinking water containing creeping creatures. Tanakh and Targum state that people may eat fish with fins and scales from oceans and rivers. Tosefta outlines the signs of permitted locusts and clean fish, including the Leviathan. 

|וְכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֵֽין־ל֜וֹ סְנַפִּ֣יר וְקַשְׂקֶ֗שֶׂת בַּיַּמִּים֙ וּבַנְּחָלִ֔ים מִכֹּל֙ שֶׁ֣רֶץ הַמַּ֔יִם וּמִכֹּ֛ל נֶ֥פֶשׁ הַחַיָּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּמָּ֑יִם שֶׁ֥קֶץ הֵ֖ם לָכֶֽם׃|10|But anything in the seas or in the streams that has no fins and scales, among all the swarming things of the water and among all the other living creatures that are in the water—they are an abomination for you|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban, Rashi, Or HaChaim, Malbim, Rav Hirsch, Ibn Ezra, and Steinsaltz discuss the classification and significance of sea creatures in Leviticus, with a focus on the prohibition of consuming those without fins and scales. Halakhic sources like Ramban, Tiferet Yisra'el, and the Gemara address specific guidelines for kosher fish and the consumption of aquatic creatures. Sifra Shemini explains the identification of forbidden species based on characteristics, while the Talmud emphasizes the transgression of eating non-kosher fish and the prohibition against consuming detestable sea creatures. The Torah and Targum both highlight the impurity of sea creatures lacking fins and scales. 

|וְשֶׁ֖קֶץ יִהְי֣וּ לָכֶ֑ם מִבְּשָׂרָם֙ לֹ֣א תֹאכֵ֔לוּ וְאֶת־נִבְלָתָ֖ם תְּשַׁקֵּֽצוּ׃|11|and an abomination for you they shall remain: you shall not eat of their flesh and you shall abominate their carcasses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban distinguishes between mousclions and yavchushim, emphasizing the prohibition against trading in non-kosher creatures. Halakhah details the criteria for identifying kosher fish and the prohibition of impure fish and swarming creatures. Jewish Thought highlights the severity of impurity from certain creeping creatures. Midrash emphasizes the importance of fins and scales for kosher fish and the quantity of unclean fish that can be mixed with clean fish. Mishnah discusses various forbidden actions warranting flogging and ineffective vows. Quoting Commentary references forbidden actions that lead to punishment, the status of attached stones, and forbidden creatures. Talmud addresses the avoidance of creeping animals and the permission of worms in fish. Targum agrees on the prohibition of certain animals and the repulsiveness of their carcasses. 

|כֹּ֣ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵֽין־ל֛וֹ סְנַפִּ֥יר וְקַשְׂקֶ֖שֶׂת בַּמָּ֑יִם שֶׁ֥קֶץ ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|12|Everything in water that has no fins and scales shall be an abomination for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The repetition of the law regarding fish with fins and scales clarifies that even if a fish loses its fins and scales after being taken out of the water, it is still permissible to eat, with distinctions made between running water and contained water. The detestable nature of creatures without fins and scales is emphasized, with trading or eating such animals forbidden. Commandments regarding forbidden relationships and impure animals have unique legal consequences, with the term "karet" encompassing them all. The prohibition of consuming sea creatures without fins and scales is discussed, stating that even if they lose their signs of cleanliness in the water, they are still forbidden to eat, and trading in them is also prohibited. The criteria for determining if a fish is kosher based on the presence of fins and scales is discussed, emphasizing the diversity within species. Rebbi Zeˋira interprets worship of celestial bodies as bodies, not deities, while Rebbi Abba bar Zemina argues that "and" implies additions, not principle and detail. Targum explains that any sea creature without fins and scales is considered repulsive and an abomination. 

|וְאֶת־אֵ֙לֶּה֙ תְּשַׁקְּצ֣וּ מִן־הָע֔וֹף לֹ֥א יֵאָכְל֖וּ שֶׁ֣קֶץ הֵ֑ם אֶת־הַנֶּ֙שֶׁר֙ וְאֶת־הַפֶּ֔רֶס וְאֵ֖ת הָעׇזְנִיָּֽה׃|13|The following  you shall abominate among the birds—they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, and the black vulture;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah explicitly prohibits the consumption of certain birds, such as eagles and vultures, based on physical characteristics associated with impurity and promoting spiritual purity rather than solely focusing on health concerns. Specific non-kosher bird species are mentioned, with consuming them resulting in lashes according to Scripture. The identification of forbidden birds is based on physical features like toe arrangement and gizzard, with all other birds considered pure unless exhibiting these characteristics. Rabbi Akiva explains that birds forbidden to eat correspond to specific commands and blessings, while Rabbi Yishmael adds that certain birds are unclean based on physical characteristics. The Talmud teaches that the nesher is a non-kosher bird, and Deuteronomy 14:12 lists prohibited birds like the eagle and vulture. The Torah's food prohibitions aim to promote spiritual purity and a holy soul, with the German Commentary on Mishnah suggesting that the bird "Os" may refer to the sea eagle. 

|וְאֶ֨ת־הַדָּאָ֔ה וְאֶת־הָאַיָּ֖ה לְמִינָֽהּ׃|14|the kite, falcons of every variety;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah lists 24 non-kosher species of birds, including the eagle, ossifrage, osprey, kite, and vulture. The repetition of permitted animals in Deuteronomy adds the השסועה and ראה, while the list in Leviticus includes דאה. In Chullin 63b:8, Isi ben Yehuda mentions one hundred non-kosher birds in the East, and in Berakhot 53b:32, the Sages interpret Leviticus 20:26 to refer to handwashing before meals, oil, and the Grace after Meals blessing. The Targum translations of Leviticus 11:14 mention the falcon, tearing vulture, kite, and vulture according to their kinds. 

|אֵ֥ת כׇּל־עֹרֵ֖ב לְמִינֽוֹ׃|15|all varieties of raven;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Rivkah's difficult pregnancy as a sign of Esau's unworthiness. Halakhah prohibits the High Priest from having relations with a widow, and lists the non-kosher species of fowl. The Midrash explores different types of ravens, while the Talmud identifies various birds as kosher or non-kosher. Tanakh mentions the raven sent out by Noah, and Targum emphasizes the importance of ravens staying with their own kind. 

|וְאֵת֙ בַּ֣ת הַֽיַּעֲנָ֔ה וְאֶת־הַתַּחְמָ֖ס וְאֶת־הַשָּׁ֑חַף וְאֶת־הַנֵּ֖ץ לְמִינֵֽהוּ׃|16|the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull; hawks of every variety;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, including Rashi, Steinsaltz, and Ibn Ezra, discuss different birds mentioned in Leviticus, such as the ostrich, hawk, and seagull, and their implications in Jewish law. The Talmud delves into the identification of these birds and the prohibition of non-kosher eggs, while the Tanakh lists specific unclean birds, including the owl, cormorant, and nighthawk. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also identify the ostrich, owl, seagull, and sparrow-hawk as unclean birds according to Leviticus. Additionally, there is discussion on forbidden food products from species that warrant lashes, such as milk from certain animals or eggs from specific birds. 

|וְאֶת־הַכּ֥וֹס וְאֶת־הַשָּׁלָ֖ךְ וְאֶת־הַיַּנְשֽׁוּף׃|17|the little owl, the cormorant, and the great owl;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Onkelos, and Targum Jonathan explain various birds mentioned in Leviticus 11:17, such as the "shelach" bird that draws fish out of the sea, the "kos" and "yanshuf" owls, the "shalakh" cormorant that casts its offspring down, and the "kos" little owl that hides in uninhabited places. The Talmud and Midrash provide additional interpretations and stories about these birds, including the hoopoe bringing the shamir worm for the Temple and the gier-eagle's sound signaling mercy and the Messianic period. Deuteronomy 14:16 and Leviticus 11:16 list other unclean birds such as the ostrich, nighthawk, sea gull, and various hawks. Rav Yehuda in the Talmud identifies the shalakh as a non-kosher bird that scoops fish out of the sea, and the dukhifat as a bird with a bent comb that brought the shamir worm to the Temple for King Solomon. Psalms 102:7 refers to a specific bird mentioned in Leviticus 11:17 as the "kippoz." 

|וְאֶת־הַתִּנְשֶׁ֥מֶת וְאֶת־הַקָּאָ֖ת וְאֶת־הָרָחָֽם׃|18|the white owl, the pelican, and the bustard;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various birds mentioned in Leviticus 11:18 include the barn owl, eagle-owl, roller, horned owl, pelican, and carrion-vulture, with the horned owl described as astonishing and the pelican known to regurgitate food. The Talmud identifies the tinshemet as the ba'ut, with the ba'ut among birds known as the kifof and the pelican possibly being the qīq oil. Deuteronomy 14:17 lists unclean birds like the pelican, bustard, and cormorant, while Targum Jonathan on Leviticus 11:18 includes the bustard, cuckoo, and woodpecker as unclean birds. 

|וְאֵת֙ הַחֲסִידָ֔ה הָאֲנָפָ֖ה לְמִינָ֑הּ וְאֶת־הַדּוּכִיפַ֖ת וְאֶת־הָעֲטַלֵּֽף׃|19|the stork; herons of every variety; the hoopoe, and the bat.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chasida is the white stork known for its kindness in sharing food, the Anafah is a hot-tempered bird possibly a heron, and the Dukhifat is a wild rooster with a double comb, also known as the hoopoe. The Torah explicitly mentions the non-kosher species of fowl, leaving the remainder as kosher, with 24 forbidden species including the eagle, ossifrage, osprey, kite, vulture, raven, starling, ostrich, owl, gull, hawk, gosshawk, falcon, cormorant, ibis, swan, pelican, magpie, stork, heron, hoopie, and bat. A pious person is called so because they have a sense of shame, necessary for fulfilling the Torah and attaining true reverence of God. Rav Yehuda identifies the shalakh as a non-kosher bird that scoops fish out of the sea, and the dukhifat as a bird with a bent comb, which brought the shamir to the Temple, while explaining that the ḥasida is a white dayya bird known for its charity towards other birds, and the anafa is an irritable dayya bird that quarrels with its fellows. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the white stork, heron, hoopoe, woodcock, and bat in their commentaries on Leviticus 11:19, emphasizing the importance of each animal staying within its own kind. 

|כֹּ֚ל שֶׁ֣רֶץ הָע֔וֹף הַהֹלֵ֖ךְ עַל־אַרְבַּ֑ע שֶׁ֥קֶץ ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|20|All winged swarming things that walk on fours shall be an abomination for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that "sheretz ha'oph" refers to flying creatures with four legs, while "oph" refers to those with two legs, violating this prohibition results in whipping as punishment. Rambam establishes that a creature can be prohibited three times, with consumption leading to stripes punishment. Rabbi Zadok testified about the cleanliness of brine from unclean locusts, contradicting a previous mishnah. The Gemara questions the necessity of inferring the permissibility of consuming honey from bees. In Deuteronomy 14:19, all winged swarming things are deemed impure. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan specify that flying reptiles with four legs are considered abominations, except for honey. 

|אַ֤ךְ אֶת־זֶה֙ תֹּֽאכְל֔וּ מִכֹּל֙ שֶׁ֣רֶץ הָע֔וֹף הַהֹלֵ֖ךְ עַל־אַרְבַּ֑ע אֲשֶׁר־ כְרָעַ֙יִם֙ מִמַּ֣עַל לְרַגְלָ֔יו לְנַתֵּ֥ר בָּהֵ֖ן עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|21|But these you may eat among all the winged swarming things that walk on fours: all that have, above their feet, jointed legs to leap with on the ground—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes learning remedies in Leviticus, acting with vengeance according to God's will. Halakhah discusses signs of kosher grasshoppers and locusts. Midrash contrasts the fate of Titus and Aaron's sons, explores Torah rejection by nations. Musar discusses speech transgressions and sin restitution. Quoting commentary focuses on clean and forbidden foods, locust signs, and Canaanite possessions. Second Temple symbolism in Leviticus, Talmud discusses 'lo' expressions and exile terms. Targum permits consumption of flying insects with specific characteristics. 

|אֶת־אֵ֤לֶּה מֵהֶם֙ תֹּאכֵ֔לוּ אֶת־הָֽאַרְבֶּ֣ה לְמִינ֔וֹ וְאֶת־הַסׇּלְעָ֖ם לְמִינֵ֑הוּ וְאֶת־הַחַרְגֹּ֣ל לְמִינֵ֔הוּ וְאֶת־הֶחָגָ֖ב לְמִינֵֽהוּ׃|22|of these you may eat the following:  locusts of every variety; all varieties of bald locust; crickets of every variety; and all varieties of grasshopper.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Certain species of flying swarming creatures, such as the locust, bald locust, cricket, and grasshopper, are permitted for consumption according to Leviticus 11:22, with specific signs to determine their kashrut status. The Mishnah discusses blessings over food items and the permissibility of using superstitious remedies for healing. The Talmud specifies certain insects that are permissible to eat and discusses the kosher status of species based on their appearance. The Tanakh mentions the gathering of spoil like locusts and grasshoppers, possibly for food. The Targum lists various types of locusts and grasshoppers that are permitted for consumption. 

|וְכֹל֙ שֶׁ֣רֶץ הָע֔וֹף אֲשֶׁר־ל֖וֹ אַרְבַּ֣ע רַגְלָ֑יִם שֶׁ֥קֶץ ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|23|But all other winged swarming things that have four legs shall be an abomination for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The repetition of the ruling in Leviticus 11:23 clarifies that creatures with five legs are permitted to be eaten. Locusts are considered clean if they have long legs and wings covering their body, while fish and locusts can be eaten without ritual slaughter. Birds must be killed by Shechitah, and creatures from the earth have their blood covered with earth, while those from water must have their blood poured out. Grasshoppers with five legs are considered clean. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret creatures with four feet as repulsive or abominable. 

|וּלְאֵ֖לֶּה תִּטַּמָּ֑אוּ כׇּל־הַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בְּנִבְלָתָ֖ם יִטְמָ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|24|And the following shall make you impure—whoever touches their carcasses shall be impure until evening,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The laws of ritual impurity related to touching unclean animal carcasses require immersion for purification, with distinctions made between animals fit and unfit for food. A limb separated from a living fowl does not impart impurity, while contact with a carcass is a positive commandment that one can choose to follow. The distinctions between different types of impurity and purification processes are emphasized in maintaining ritual purity. The text discusses the specific requirements for different types of impurity, such as ever min hechai and ever min hameth, and the importance of following these distinctions in determining purity laws related to various types of animal flesh. Touching the thigh bone of a human corpse or sacrificial animal imparts impurity based on size and perforation, with the comparison of impurity laws for those who come into contact with creeping animals and those with seminal emissions. Touching the external side of a carcass aligning with the flesh also causes impurity. 

|וְכׇל־הַנֹּשֵׂ֖א מִנִּבְלָתָ֑ם יְכַבֵּ֥ס בְּגָדָ֖יו וְטָמֵ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|25|and whoever carries the carcasses of any of them shall wash those clothes and be impure until evening—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the different levels of ritual impurity caused by touching and carrying unclean objects, emphasizing the need for washing garments after contact. Specific criteria are given for determining impurity, such as the distinction between different types of impure objects and the size of a barley grain required for imparting impurity. The importance of cleanliness and purification is highlighted throughout the commentary, including the laws regarding bathing and laundering clothes for purification. The Talmud debates the requirements for impurity via carrying, with different opinions on the amount of flesh needed to transmit impurity. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Leviticus 11:25 as requiring washing garments after carrying an unclean carcass. 

|לְֽכׇל־הַבְּהֵמָ֡ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר הִוא֩ מַפְרֶ֨סֶת פַּרְסָ֜ה וְשֶׁ֣סַע ׀ אֵינֶ֣נָּה שֹׁסַ֗עַת וְגֵרָה֙ אֵינֶ֣נָּה מַעֲלָ֔ה טְמֵאִ֥ים הֵ֖ם לָכֶ֑ם כׇּל־הַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בָּהֶ֖ם יִטְמָֽא׃|26|every animal that has true hoofs but without clefts through the hoofs, or that does not chew the cud. They are impure for you; whoever touches them shall be impure.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Rashi, Rashbam, and Malbim, discuss the laws of ritual impurity related to touching carcasses of unclean animals, emphasizing the importance of proper slaughter for purification. The Sefer HaChinukh highlights that commandments are for human benefit, not God's, while Mishneh Torah specifies that a limb separated from a living fowl does not cause impurity. The Midrash delves into the specifics of tumah laws for different animals and actions, while the Talmud and Targum address additional nuances and prohibitions related to impurity and unclean animals. 

|וְכֹ֣ל ׀ הוֹלֵ֣ךְ עַל־כַּפָּ֗יו בְּכׇל־הַֽחַיָּה֙ הַהֹלֶ֣כֶת עַל־אַרְבַּ֔ע טְמֵאִ֥ים הֵ֖ם לָכֶ֑ם כׇּל־הַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בְּנִבְלָתָ֖ם יִטְמָ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|27|Also all animals that walk on paws, among those that walk on fours, are impure for you; whoever touches their carcasses shall be impure until evening.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that animals like dogs, bears, and cats are considered unclean due to walking on their paws, while Tur HaArokh discusses the distinction between בהמה and חיה in the Torah's classification of animals. Malbim provides rules for interpreting repeated sections in the Torah, Ibn Ezra notes the law regarding animals walking on paws applies to all of Israel. Bartenura clarifies that contact with carrion or lustration waters without carrying them does not defile clothing, as stated in Leviticus and Numbers. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili interprets Leviticus 11:27 to render impure animals without cloven hooves found inside a live animal, while Targum explains that animals that walk on their paws and have four legs are considered unclean. 

|וְהַנֹּשֵׂא֙ אֶת־נִבְלָתָ֔ם יְכַבֵּ֥ס בְּגָדָ֖יו וְטָמֵ֣א עַד־הָעָ֑רֶב טְמֵאִ֥ים הֵ֖מָּה לָכֶֽם׃|28|And anyone who carries their carcasses shall wash those clothes and remain impure until evening. They are impure for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moving a carcass can confer ritual impurity through minimal motion, as explained by various commentators. The impurity from carrying a human corpse is derived from the Oral Tradition, and impurity from dead animal carcasses is primary, transmitted through contact or carrying. The Midrash explains that the carrier confers tumah upon his clothing when carrying a carcass. Ramban emphasizes that commandments regarding animals are meant to teach compassion and prevent cruelty. The Talmud discusses trade regulations regarding items forbidden by the Torah and rabbinical prohibitions, exceptions for animals raised for work, and clarifies that certain abominations are forbidden only when they exist independently. 

|וְזֶ֤ה לָכֶם֙ הַטָּמֵ֔א בַּשֶּׁ֖רֶץ הַשֹּׁרֵ֣ץ עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ הַחֹ֥לֶד וְהָעַכְבָּ֖ר וְהַצָּ֥ב לְמִינֵֽהוּ׃|29|The following  shall be impure for you from among the things that swarm on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and great lizards of every variety;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various creatures, including weasels, toads, and swarming creatures on land, cause ritual impurity upon contact, with distinctions made between impurity from contact with their bodies versus blood. The Torah specifies measurements determining the level of impurity, limited to Jews and not Gentiles, with serpents considered more spiritually intense. The commandment of impurity from eight swarming creatures is derived from Leviticus 11:29, with specific rules for liability and Sabbath laws regarding these creatures. Impure spirits are said to inhabit forms of impure animals like pigs, separate from pure spirits, and returning to their own kind. Moses is shown various things by God, including the preparation of anointing oil and impure animals, while the Mishnah discusses trapping or wounding creeping animals on Shabbat and different levels of impurity. The Talmud outlines rules for impurity related to creeping animals, with distinctions between types and their blood and flesh. Rashba recommends soaking beans containing insects before cooking, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan list unclean creatures like weasels and toads. 

|וְהָאֲנָקָ֥ה וְהַכֹּ֖חַ וְהַלְּטָאָ֑ה וְהַחֹ֖מֶט וְהַתִּנְשָֽׁמֶת׃|30|the gecko, the land crocodile, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Steinsaltz identify specific impure creatures in Leviticus 11:30 as the hedgehog, lizard, snail, and mole, with additional creatures like the shrew, monitor, and skink prohibited. The Mishnah discusses various laws related to impurity, including the handling of creeping animal carcasses on Shabbat and differing opinions on impurity of flesh and bone. The Talmud delves into the liability of trapping or wounding certain creatures on Shabbat, while the Targum lists unclean animals like the hedgehog and chameleon in Leviticus 11:30. Rabbi Yehuda in the Tosefta discusses impurity of meat residue, tanning of skins, and the impurity of certain creatures and eggs. 

|אֵ֛לֶּה הַטְּמֵאִ֥ים לָכֶ֖ם בְּכׇל־הַשָּׁ֑רֶץ כׇּל־הַנֹּגֵ֧עַ בָּהֶ֛ם בְּמֹתָ֖ם יִטְמָ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|31|Those are for you the impure among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until evening.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbis interpret Leviticus 11:31 differently, discussing the impurity of swarming creatures; Halakhah explains the specifics of impurity caused by touching these creatures; Midrash details which creatures confer tumah and how impurity spreads; Mishnah mentions impurity related to idolatrous objects and fallen walls; Quoting Commentary compares the impurity of creeping things to that of idolatrous objects; Talmud explores ritual impurity related to creeping animals; Targum specifies the types of reptiles that render someone unclean by touching them. 

|וְכֹ֣ל אֲשֶׁר־יִפֹּל־עָלָיו֩ מֵהֶ֨ם ׀ בְּמֹתָ֜ם יִטְמָ֗א מִכׇּל־כְּלִי־עֵץ֙ א֣וֹ בֶ֤גֶד אוֹ־עוֹר֙ א֣וֹ שָׂ֔ק כׇּל־כְּלִ֕י אֲשֶׁר־יֵעָשֶׂ֥ה מְלָאכָ֖ה בָּהֶ֑ם בַּמַּ֧יִם יוּבָ֛א וְטָמֵ֥א עַד־הָעֶ֖רֶב וְטָהֵֽר׃|32|And anything on which one of them falls when dead shall be impure: be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack—any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water, and it shall remain impure until evening; then it shall be pure.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Rebbe visited the Baal Shem Tov's grave at night and immersed in a mikvah for purification, even in extreme cold. The text discusses the impurity of vessels, the requirement for a priest to wait until sunset after immersion, the types of vessels susceptible to impurity, the exemption of sea-animal vessels, the minimum size for impurity contraction, the purification process, zizit obligation, and metal utensil defilement. Specific requirements for impurity, including lentil size for contact with sea-lizards, tumah connections, and different durations of tumah are discussed. Mishnah Kelim 21:1 details what parts of a loom or spinning apparatus render a person unclean. Ramban explains the purification process for vessels, while Targum discusses the need for washing and purification of items touched by a dead animal. 

|וְכׇ֨ל־כְּלִי־חֶ֔רֶשׂ אֲשֶׁר־יִפֹּ֥ל מֵהֶ֖ם אֶל־תּוֹכ֑וֹ כֹּ֣ל אֲשֶׁ֧ר בְּתוֹכ֛וֹ יִטְמָ֖א וְאֹת֥וֹ תִשְׁבֹּֽרוּ׃|33|And if any of those falls into an earthen vessel, everything inside it shall be impure and [the vessel] itself you shall break.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Earthen vessels become impure through their interior, making anything inside them impure, and must be broken for purification, unlike other impure vessels that can be purified through immersion. Different types of keilim contract impurity in different ways, with earthenware containers being unique in their susceptibility to impurity. The Talmud discusses how impurity can be transmitted from impure earthenware vessels to other items, including food, with various degrees of ritual impurity and purification processes presented by different rabbis. Rabbi Akiva explains that an impure earthenware vessel can transmit impurity to other items, as stated in Leviticus 11:33, while Rabbi Yehoshua challenges this interpretation. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that if any unclean creatures fall into an earthen vessel, the vessel becomes unclean and must be broken. 

|מִכׇּל־הָאֹ֜כֶל אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵאָכֵ֗ל אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָב֥וֹא עָלָ֛יו מַ֖יִם יִטְמָ֑א וְכׇל־מַשְׁקֶה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִשָּׁתֶ֔ה בְּכׇל־כְּלִ֖י יִטְמָֽא׃|34|As to any food that may be eaten, it shall become impure if it came in contact with water;  as to any liquid that may be drunk, it shall become impure if it was inside any vessel.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators provide interpretations on Leviticus 11:34, discussing how impure food only transmits impurity if it is the size of an egg, the laws of impurity regarding foods and drinks, the conditions under which food and drink can acquire tumah, the restrictions on a "chaver," and the implications of water on food and liquids for impurity. Ramban and Bartenura elaborate on the impurity of food and liquids, while the Talmud explores the distinctions between food and liquids in transmitting impurity and the susceptibility of food to impurity. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that any food or beverage coming into contact with water in a vessel will be considered unclean. 

|וְ֠כֹ֠ל אֲשֶׁר־יִפֹּ֨ל מִנִּבְלָתָ֥ם ׀ עָלָיו֮ יִטְמָא֒ תַּנּ֧וּר וְכִירַ֛יִם יֻתָּ֖ץ טְמֵאִ֣ים הֵ֑ם וּטְמֵאִ֖ים יִהְי֥וּ לָכֶֽם׃|35|Everything on which the carcass of any of them falls shall be impure: an oven or stove shall be smashed. They are impure—and impure they shall remain for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the impurity of ovens and ranges made of clay when they come into contact with carcasses of certain animals, stating that they must be destroyed to the point where they can no longer serve their original purpose. Stone ovens are always pure, while metal ovens can contract impurity but can be purified through immersion in a mikveh. The Midrash discusses different types of tumah related to vessels and carcasses, providing guidelines for determining tumah based on size and composition. The Talmud discusses disagreements on whether an intact oven can become impure, and the importance of serving sages and continually learning. The Targum states that objects on which a part of the carcass of an unclean animal falls, such as ovens and pans, must be broken. Terumah oil cannot be used to anoint impure hands, but can be rubbed on meat even with impure hands. 

|אַ֣ךְ מַעְיָ֥ן וּב֛וֹר מִקְוֵה־מַ֖יִם יִהְיֶ֣ה טָה֑וֹר וְנֹגֵ֥עַ בְּנִבְלָתָ֖ם יִטְמָֽא׃|36|However, a spring or cistern in which water is collected shall be pure, but whoever touches such a carcass in it shall be impure.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Leviticus 11:36 clarifies that detached water can become impure if a carcass falls into it, while attached water in springs or cisterns remains clean. According to Halakhah, immersion in a mikveh is permissible if the water is natural and not drawn, with mayim she’uvim being disqualified. The Midrash discusses the importance of Torah teachings and the laws of impurity, while Mishnah Eduyot and Yadayim address the level of impurity of flesh and bones, and the cleanliness of water sources. The Talmud emphasizes the purity of water from natural sources, while the Tanakh recounts the story of Joseph being sold into slavery by his brothers. Targum Onkelos and Jonathan explain that water in wellsprings and pits is pure, but contact with unclean carcasses renders it impure. 

|וְכִ֤י יִפֹּל֙ מִנִּבְלָתָ֔ם עַל־כׇּל־זֶ֥רַע זֵר֖וּעַ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִזָּרֵ֑עַ טָה֖וֹר הֽוּא׃|37|If such a carcass falls upon seed grain that is to be sown, it is pure;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators discuss the concept of seeds becoming susceptible to impurity only after contact with water, emphasizing the importance of water in this process and the distinction between seeds for planting and food. The Torah states that food must first come into contact with water to become impure and that even seeds for sowing can become impure if moistened. Additionally, the law of making food susceptible to impurity also applies to impurity conveyed by carrion, with a uniform standard for all food items. Shomerim of food contract impurity with the food when connected, including kernels like wheat, barley, and lentils in their coverings, as well as other shomerim. The text explores the implications of seeds becoming tamei when water or a sheretz falls on them, clarifying the need for conditioning by water for tumah to be conferred and discussing the tumah status of plant parts used for consumption. Rabbi Shimon holds that seeds in a perforated pot cannot become ritually impure but can in an imperforated pot, with the Torah specifying that seeds can contract impurity from a carcass only after contact with water. Shells are considered part of the grain for combining for ritual impurity, and the Torah extends the purity of growing plants to anything sown in an acceptable agricultural manner. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan specify that sown dry seed remains clean even if a carcass falls on it. 

|וְכִ֤י יֻתַּן־מַ֙יִם֙ עַל־זֶ֔רַע וְנָפַ֥ל מִנִּבְלָתָ֖ם עָלָ֑יו טָמֵ֥א ה֖וּא לָכֶֽם׃|38|but if water is put on the seed and any part of a carcass falls upon it, it shall be impure for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept that water on seed makes it susceptible to uncleanness, even after it has been plucked, applies to any liquids and even if the seed falls into the water. Food designated for human consumption is susceptible to ritual impurity unless specified otherwise, and the laws surrounding impurity are derived from Leviticus 11:38. The Midrash emphasizes the relationship between different matters of Torah and the importance of the words of the scribes. Mishnah passages discuss laws regarding impurity in various scenarios, such as contact with impure objects and lending items during the sabbatical year. The Talmud addresses scenarios where food items become susceptible to ritual impurity through contact with liquid, emphasizing the role of intent. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Leviticus 11:38 state that water on seeds and part of a carcass falling on them renders the seeds unclean. 

|וְכִ֤י יָמוּת֙ מִן־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־הִ֥יא לָכֶ֖ם לְאׇכְלָ֑ה הַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בְּנִבְלָתָ֖הּ יִטְמָ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|39|If an animal that you may eat has died, anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening;|

The commentary, halakhah, Midrash, Mishnah, Talmud, Tanakh, and Targum all discuss various aspects of the laws regarding impurity from animal carcasses, including the distinctions between different types of animals, the implications of ritual slaughter, the purification processes involved in handling carcasses, and specific criteria for what constitutes a carcass that confers impurity. These texts also address the nuances of carrying and touching carcasses, the impurity of animal fat, and the rules regarding the impurity of animal bones, among other topics. 

|וְהָֽאֹכֵל֙ מִנִּבְלָתָ֔הּ יְכַבֵּ֥ס בְּגָדָ֖יו וְטָמֵ֣א עַד־הָעָ֑רֶב וְהַנֹּשֵׂא֙ אֶת־נִבְלָתָ֔הּ יְכַבֵּ֥ס בְּגָדָ֖יו וְטָמֵ֥א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃|40|anyone who eats of its carcass shall wash those clothes and remain impure until evening; and anyone who carries its carcass shall wash those clothes and remain impure until evening.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses impurity from eating, carrying, and touching animal carcasses, with a focus on the size required for impurity, the severity of uncleanness from carrying versus touching, and the specific creatures that confer impurity. Halakhah states impurity from touching clean animal carcasses and carrying human corpses is a Scriptural Law, while the Mishnah outlines rules for impurity from different types of bones. The Talmud explores purity distinctions between sealed and perforated bones and the requirements for impurity via carrying. Targum emphasizes the need to wash clothes after eating or carrying unclean animal carcasses. 

|וְכׇל־הַשֶּׁ֖רֶץ הַשֹּׁרֵ֣ץ עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ שֶׁ֥קֶץ ה֖וּא לֹ֥א יֵאָכֵֽל׃|41|All the things that swarm upon the earth are an abomination; they shall not be eaten.|

The regulations on forbidden foods are based on principles of ritual slaughter, with birds needing one vital pipe severed, fish not requiring slaughter, and locusts mentioned after fish to avoid confusion. The laws are ordered to reflect varying life intensity and the importance of ritual slaughter over physical health. The laws of impurity and purity remind individuals to maintain a spiritually free existence, emphasizing the distinction between physical necessity and moral freedom.

The Mishnah discusses the halakhic status of a tereifa bird's carcass, with differing opinions on purification. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits ignoramuses from eating meat without Torah study, and the Talmud debates the requirements for the slaughter of birds. 

|לְהַבְדִּ֕יל בֵּ֥ין הַטָּמֵ֖א וּבֵ֣ין הַטָּהֹ֑ר וּבֵ֤ין הַֽחַיָּה֙ הַֽנֶּאֱכֶ֔לֶת וּבֵין֙ הַֽחַיָּ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר לֹ֥א תֵאָכֵֽל׃|47|for distinguishing between the impure and the pure, between the living things that may be eaten and the living things that may not be eaten.|
