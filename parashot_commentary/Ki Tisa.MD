## Exodus 30

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|11|יהוה spoke to Moses, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The silver collected for the Mishkan was counted by Moshe, emphasizing the connection between the nation and the Temple, with the silver used for the Temple's service. When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on the Sabbath, Parashat Shekalim is read, with specific Torah portions read on four Shabbatot in Adar. In Midrash Tanchuma, it is explained that reading the portion containing Shekalim symbolizes forgiveness and the lifting of the Israelites' heads by Moses. The Talmud discusses the reading of Shekalim on Purim, with different opinions on the Torah portion to be read. 

|כִּ֣י תִשָּׂ֞א אֶת־רֹ֥אשׁ בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ לִפְקֻדֵיהֶם֒ וְנָ֨תְנ֜וּ אִ֣ישׁ כֹּ֧פֶר נַפְשׁ֛וֹ לַיהֹוָ֖ה בִּפְקֹ֣ד אֹתָ֑ם וְלֹא־יִהְיֶ֥ה בָהֶ֛ם נֶ֖גֶף בִּפְקֹ֥ד אֹתָֽם׃|12|When you take a census of the Israelite men according to their army enrollment, each shall pay יהוה a ransom for himself on being enrolled, that no plague may come upon them through their being enrolled.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the significance of giving a half-shekel as a ransom for the soul when counting the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging one's role in the community and avoiding divine anger. Halakhah derives the commandment to give a half-shekel annually from Exodus 30:12 to prevent a plague during census-taking, with King David's census without a valid purpose serving as a cautionary tale. Liturgy recounts how God instructed Moses to use a numerical device to count the people and give a ransom for their souls, with a fiery coin symbolizing atonement. Midrash highlights the importance of Israel being chosen before creation, the Temple being built in heaven, and repentance established before the world was created. Mishnah explains the collection of shekels by money changers and the collateral taken from those who had not donated, noting exceptions for certain groups. Musar reflects on the atonement process and Jacob's success in battle attributed to charity, the struggle against evil, and prayer. Quoting Commentary warns of the risks of counting individuals in the Torah and the need for a ransom to avoid divine anger. Second Temple discusses the didrachmon divided in half as a ransom for the soul and the unfree aspects represented by the mind, senses, and passions. Talmud clarifies the reading of the portion of Shekalim and disagreements on who should give the half shekel, while also discussing charity and the consequences of David's actions. Tanakh recounts how the LORD incited David to take a census, leading to a large number of soldiers being revealed and David later regretting his decision. Targum emphasizes the need for each man of the B'nei Yisrael to give an atonement pledge for his soul to prevent a plague during counting. 

|זֶ֣ה ׀ יִתְּנ֗וּ כׇּל־הָעֹבֵר֙ עַל־הַפְּקֻדִ֔ים מַחֲצִ֥ית הַשֶּׁ֖קֶל בְּשֶׁ֣קֶל הַקֹּ֑דֶשׁ עֶשְׂרִ֤ים גֵּרָה֙ הַשֶּׁ֔קֶל מַחֲצִ֣ית הַשֶּׁ֔קֶל תְּרוּמָ֖ה לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|13|This is what everyone who is entered in the records shall pay: a half-shekel by the sanctuary weight—twenty gerahs to the shekel—a half-shekel as an offering to יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the significance of the half shekel donation in Exodus 30:13, connecting it to serving God with intention and tangible action. The shekel is considered holy, symbolizing atonement, charity, and stopping plagues, with contributions accepted from all adult Jewish males annually. The Mishnah details obligations for different groups, while the Talmud discusses various contributions and interpretations of the half sheqel. In Nehemiah 10:33, people commit to contributing one-third of a shekel annually for the House of God. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of giving a half shekel of the sanctuary coin as a separation before the Lord. 

|כֹּ֗ל הָעֹבֵר֙ עַל־הַפְּקֻדִ֔ים מִבֶּ֛ן עֶשְׂרִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וָמָ֑עְלָה יִתֵּ֖ן תְּרוּמַ֥ת יְהֹוָֽה׃|14|Everyone who is entered in the records, from the age of twenty years up, shall give יהוה’s offering:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the age requirement for joining the army, with anyone less than twenty years old excluded. The purpose of the half-shekel contribution is for atonement, calculated based on estimated lifespan. The Shulchan Aruch does not agree with Rashi's discovery due to concerns about the weight loss of the shekel and reliance on non-observant archaeologists. Money changers collected shekels on specific dates, with collateral seized from those who did not donate, except for women, slaves, and minors. The silver contributed for the Tabernacle consisted of half-shekels, with leftover silver used for hooks and fillets. Rebbi Ḥaggai discusses three contributions for construction, communal sacrifices, and the Sanctuary, meant to be equal for everyone. The census included only eligible male descendants of the Israelites who were twenty years old and above. 

|הֶֽעָשִׁ֣יר לֹֽא־יַרְבֶּ֗ה וְהַדַּל֙ לֹ֣א יַמְעִ֔יט מִֽמַּחֲצִ֖ית הַשָּׁ֑קֶל לָתֵת֙ אֶת־תְּרוּמַ֣ת יְהֹוָ֔ה לְכַפֵּ֖ר עַל־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶֽם׃|15|the rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less than half a shekel when giving יהוה’s offering as expiation for your persons.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the significance of wealth in relation to Sodom, Rachel, Leah, and the shekel census, emphasizing the cleansing of evil desires and atonement for sins. Halakhah details the obligation of all adult Jewish males to give a half-shekel annually, with specific regulations on the weight and timing of the offering. Mishnah explains the fixed value of shekels and sin-offerings, with Rabbi Shimon emphasizing equality in contributions. Quoting Commentary explores the meanings of "kaparah" and the significance of civil laws in the Torah, while Second Temple and Talmud discuss the importance of equality in the distribution of divine things and the connection between repentance and the coming of David's son. Targum emphasizes the requirement for both the rich and poor to give half a shekel as a terumah-offering for atonement. 

|וְלָקַחְתָּ֞ אֶת־כֶּ֣סֶף הַכִּפֻּרִ֗ים מֵאֵת֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְנָתַתָּ֣ אֹת֔וֹ עַל־עֲבֹדַ֖ת אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד וְהָיָה֩ לִבְנֵ֨י יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל לְזִכָּרוֹן֙ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה לְכַפֵּ֖ר עַל־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶֽם׃|16|You shall take the expiation money from the Israelites and assign it to the service of the Tent of Meeting; it shall serve the Israelites as a reminder before יהוה, as expiation for your persons.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The atonement money collected from the Israelites was used to make sockets and hooks for the Tabernacle, serving as a memorial and atonement for their souls. The census was taken before the Tabernacle's erection to ensure contributions from all Israelites, with the silver considered charity linked to rainfall in Israel. The reading of Parashat Shekalim on the Shabbos before Rosh Chodesh Adar reminds Jews to give the yearly half-shekel for communal offerings, commemorating the Temple. God caused David to stumble by counting the Israelites without taking a ransom, resulting in a pestilence that stopped when God saw something reminding Him of the Temple. The Talmud discusses the reading of the portion of "When you take the count" in relation to the collection of half-shekels, emphasizing the importance of financial contributions to the temple. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|17|יהוה spoke to Moses, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra notes the beginning of a new section in Exodus 30:17, Rav Hirsch emphasizes the symbolism of the laver ordinance for priests, and Steinsaltz simply states that the Lord spoke to Moses in that verse. In terms of Halakhah, there is a specific order for reciting passages related to the laver, ashes, continual-offering, Incense Altar, and spices of the Incense, along with the verse "And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord." Rashi explains the affectionate meaning of "For I know him" in Genesis 18:19, highlighting the close relationship between God and the individual. The Targum states that Adonoy spoke to Moshe, providing instructions. 

|וְעָשִׂ֜יתָ כִּיּ֥וֹר נְחֹ֛שֶׁת וְכַנּ֥וֹ נְחֹ֖שֶׁת לְרׇחְצָ֑ה וְנָתַתָּ֣ אֹת֗וֹ בֵּֽין־אֹ֤הֶל מוֹעֵד֙ וּבֵ֣ין הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ וְנָתַתָּ֥ שָׁ֖מָּה מָֽיִם׃|18|Make a laver of copper and a stand of copper for it, for washing; and place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar. Put water in it,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The laver was placed off-center between the tent of meeting and the altar for priests to wash before entering the sanctuary, made of bronze with twelve spouts for multiple priests to wash simultaneously. The Mishnah and Talmud provide details on the location and use of the laver, while Jewish Thought and Musar reflect on the Tabernacle's significance mirroring the universe and celestial structures. The Targum describes the purpose of the basin for purification, and Rabbeinu Bahya and Ezra ben Solomon draw parallels between the Tabernacle and the creation of the world. 

|וְרָחֲצ֛וּ אַהֲרֹ֥ן וּבָנָ֖יו מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אֶת־יְדֵיהֶ֖ם וְאֶת־רַגְלֵיהֶֽם׃|19|and let Aaron and his sons wash their hands and feet [in water drawn] from it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The priests in the Tabernacle washed their hands and feet simultaneously using a vessel for water, symbolizing holiness and reverence for God. In the Temple, failure to sanctify hands and feet before serving resulted in death. Handwashing rituals had specific requirements, with mayim rishonim being more stringent. The Sages debated whether priests could dip their hands and feet in the Basin, and defined the appropriate areas for tying shoelaces and sanctifying limbs. Aharon and his sons used water from the basin for cleansing ablutions. 

|בְּבֹאָ֞ם אֶל־אֹ֧הֶל מוֹעֵ֛ד יִרְחֲצוּ־מַ֖יִם וְלֹ֣א יָמֻ֑תוּ א֣וֹ בְגִשְׁתָּ֤ם אֶל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֙חַ֙ לְשָׁרֵ֔ת לְהַקְטִ֥יר אִשֶּׁ֖ה לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|20|When they enter the Tent of Meeting they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they approach the altar to serve, to turn into smoke an offering by fire to יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of priests washing with water before entering the Tent of Meeting or approaching the altar to avoid death, as stated in Exodus 30:20, with specific procedures outlined for purification. Aaron's sons died due to intoxication, lack of proper vestments, failure to wash hands and feet, and arrogance, highlighting the significance of following prescribed rituals and behaviors. Sacrificial items for the Tabernacle differ from private altars, with specific sacrificial rites, priestly involvement, and regulations applying equally to both. The Talmud explores requirements for priests to sanctify before Temple service, scenarios disqualifying sacrifices due to impurities, and implications of impurity of the dead for Pesaḥ. The text emphasizes the importance of purification rituals and proper conduct in divine service. 

|וְרָחֲצ֛וּ יְדֵיהֶ֥ם וְרַגְלֵיהֶ֖ם וְלֹ֣א יָמֻ֑תוּ וְהָיְתָ֨ה לָהֶ֧ם חׇק־עוֹלָ֛ם ל֥וֹ וּלְזַרְע֖וֹ לְדֹרֹתָֽם׃|21|they shall wash their hands and feet, that they may not die. It shall be a law for all time for them—for him and his offspring—throughout the ages.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the symbolic nature of washing in the Holy Temple to align one's actions with God's will, with ritual washing serving as a form of prayer. Halakhah stresses the importance of hand-washing before meals, linking it to blessings and wealth, with severe punishments for neglecting this practice. Liturgy describes the instructions for priests to wash hands and feet before serving in the Temple to avoid death, while Mishnah details the process of removing ashes from the altar. The Talmud discusses the importance of sanctifying hands and feet before service, and Tanakh lists the parts of animals to be offered as sacrifices. Targum highlights the perpetual statute of washing for Aharon and his descendants to avoid death. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|22|יהוה spoke to Moses, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anointing in Exodus 30:25 symbolizes honor and chosen status with oil, the constant and eternal liquid. Burning incense in the Temple counteracts slaughter smells, maintaining dignity and evoking respect. Rashi explains "נכאת" in II Kings 20:13:1, while II Kings 20:13:4 shows nothing was left, including the Ark and Scrolls. "Fine oil" in II Kings 20:13:2 refers to anointing oil in Eretz Yisroel. Adonoy spoke to Moshe in Exodus 30:22 according to Targum. 

|וְאַתָּ֣ה קַח־לְךָ֮ בְּשָׂמִ֣ים רֹאשׁ֒ מׇר־דְּרוֹר֙ חֲמֵ֣שׁ מֵא֔וֹת וְקִנְּמׇן־בֶּ֥שֶׂם מַחֲצִית֖וֹ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים וּמָאתָ֑יִם וּקְנֵה־בֹ֖שֶׂם חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים וּמָאתָֽיִם׃|23|Next take choice spices: five hundred weight of solidified  myrrh, half as much—two hundred and fifty—of fragrant cinnamon, two hundred and fifty of aromatic cane,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Mordechai's association with freedom and independence, symbolized by hands, and Esther's connection to thighs, representing rule and authority for serving God. Commentary discusses the identity of the spice "mor" in Exodus, with Ramban suggesting musk from a deer's gland and Ibn Ezra arguing for myrrh. Halakhah details the preparation of anointing oil with musk, cinnamon, costus, and fragrant cane in the desert. Liturgy expresses a blessing in Siddur Sefard Musaf 145 towards the Provider. Midrash explores spices in Song of Songs, Mordecai's lineage, and interpretations of verses from Isaiah and Job. Musar delves into Talmudic allusions to Moses, Haman, Mordechai, and Esther, highlighting connections between expressions in Esther and the Torah. Talmud refers to Mordecai as a cypress and Haman as a thorn, raises dilemmas in Nedarim, discusses weight of aromatic calamus in Keritot, and describes the preparation of anointing oil in Jerusalem Talmud Shekalim. Targum specifies the weights of myrrh, cinnamon, and calamus in Exodus 30:23. 

|וְקִדָּ֕ה חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת בְּשֶׁ֣קֶל הַקֹּ֑דֶשׁ וְשֶׁ֥מֶן זַ֖יִת הִֽין׃|24|five hundred—by the sanctuary weight—of cassia, and a hin of olive oil.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anointing oil used in the Temple contained specific quantities of myrrh, cassia, cinnamon, and calamus totaling 1,750 shekels, made by Moses with twelve logs of olive oil. Rabbi Yehudah mentioned miracles performed with the anointing oil, which was used to anoint various individuals and items, remaining intact for future generations. Hillel, Shammai, and the Sages disagreed on the amount of drawn water that would make a mikweh unfit, with the Sages accepting the testimony of two weavers. The composition of the anointing oil is prohibited to duplicate according to halakhah, with specific quantities and process outlined by Moses in the desert. 

|וְעָשִׂ֣יתָ אֹת֗וֹ שֶׁ֚מֶן מִשְׁחַת־קֹ֔דֶשׁ רֹ֥קַח מִרְקַ֖חַת מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה רֹקֵ֑חַ שֶׁ֥מֶן מִשְׁחַת־קֹ֖דֶשׁ יִהְיֶֽה׃|25|Make of this a sacred anointing oil, a compound of ingredients expertly blended, to serve as sacred anointing oil.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teachings explain that holy anointing oil symbolizes wisdom and good deeds, allowing the light of the Shechinah to transform darkness into light through observance of the commandments. The process of compounding the oil was known among perfumers, and the anointing oil was created with precision to sanctify the Tabernacle and its vessels. The Lord instructed Moshe to create the anointing oil with specific quantities of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, cassia, and olive oil according to the sanctuary's shekel. The anointing oil consecrates those anointed with it and the Temple vessels, ensuring sanctification for future generations. Oil symbolizes honor and stature, signifying the eternal nature of the Temple vessels, priests, and kings. Rabbi Shimon argues that the anointing oil was a work of wonders due to its small quantity and extensive use, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the process of making the sacred anointing oil with a blend of perfumes by a perfumer. 

|וּמָשַׁחְתָּ֥ ב֖וֹ אֶת־אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד וְאֵ֖ת אֲר֥וֹן הָעֵדֻֽת׃|26|With it anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Pact,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that anointing with oil includes the entire tabernacle, with a specific mention of the ark as the most important object. Rashi notes anointings in Scripture were done in the form of a Greek X, except for kings, which were done round the head like a crown. Siftei Chakhamim adds that the anointing was done in the form of a Greek chi, resembling a Hebrew nun. Steinsaltz mentions that the anointing oil is used for the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony. The size of the handful of incense used by the high priest was relative to his own size, not an absolute measure, and the incense was to be supplied from communal funds and contain all eleven spices listed in Exodus. On Yom Kippur, the High Priest uses a coal pan of gold to bring coals into the Holy of Holies, whereas on other days it is silver, with different sizes used on Yom Kippur compared to other days. Additionally, the incense used on Yom Kippur is different, with the High Priest adding an extra handful and using superfine incense. Moses anointed the Tabernacle and Aaron in the correct order, as commanded, to ensure readiness for divine service, with the anointing of Aaron's sons likely done through sprinkling. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the anointing oil should be used to anoint the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Testimony. 

|וְאֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָן֙ וְאֶת־כׇּל־כֵּלָ֔יו וְאֶת־הַמְּנֹרָ֖ה וְאֶת־כֵּלֶ֑יהָ וְאֵ֖ת מִזְבַּ֥ח הַקְּטֹֽרֶת׃|27|the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and all its fittings, the altar of incense,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The largest objects in the sanctuary were the table and the menorah, symbolizing material well-being and spiritual development respectively. The items to be anointed included the table, candelabrum, and altar of incense, as mentioned in Targum Jonathan and Onkelos in Exodus 30:27. 

|וְאֶת־מִזְבַּ֥ח הָעֹלָ֖ה וְאֶת־כׇּל־כֵּלָ֑יו וְאֶת־הַכִּיֹּ֖ר וְאֶת־כַּנּֽוֹ׃|28|the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The altar of burnt-offering and its vessels are essential utensils for the construction of the Temple, along with the basin and its base, as mentioned in Exodus 30:28. Sin-offerings are burnt outside the camp to symbolize the complete removal of sin, contrasting with the sweet savour of burnt-offerings. R. Eliezer's argument regarding meat with milk is refuted by the example of incense, suggesting that even though it is forbidden to be cooked, it may still be permitted to be eaten. The Mishnah lists actions warranting lashes, including eating sacrificial food while ritually impure and consuming forbidden fats or blood. Bartenura interprets the term "מוכני" as a wheel for lifting weights, and Targum mentions the Burnt-offering Altar and its vessels in Exodus 30:28. 

|וְקִדַּשְׁתָּ֣ אֹתָ֔ם וְהָי֖וּ קֹ֣דֶשׁ קׇֽדָשִׁ֑ים כׇּל־הַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בָּהֶ֖ם יִקְדָּֽשׁ׃|29|Thus you shall consecrate them so that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be consecrated.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anointing oil sanctifies vessels in the Tabernacle, making them holy, with anything that touches them also becoming holy. The Mishnah explains that the altar, ramp, and service vessels sanctify items suited to them, with service vessels used for liquids sanctifying only liquids and those used for dry measures sanctifying only dry items. The Talmud states that the ramp and service vessels in the Temple sanctify what is eligible for them, with the ramp included in the sanctification through the word "et" in the verse about anointing the altar. The Targum emphasizes that priests who approach sanctified items will be sanctified, while those from other tribes who touch them will be consumed by fire from the Lord. 

|וְאֶת־אַהֲרֹ֥ן וְאֶת־בָּנָ֖יו תִּמְשָׁ֑ח וְקִדַּשְׁתָּ֥ אֹתָ֖ם לְכַהֵ֥ן לִֽי׃|30|You shall also anoint Aaron and his sons, consecrating them to serve Me as priests.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Steinsaltz discuss the anointing of Aaron and his sons as priests with oil, sanctifying them for their role. The anointing of Solomon by Zadok with the Oil of Anointment was a special decree due to a conflict with Adonijah, not a typical practice for kings. The anointing oil was reserved for specific individuals like Aaron and his sons, signifying them as holy anointed ones of God. The Torah states that an unintentional murderer must remain in a city of refuge until the death of the High Priest, with different methods of appointment affecting the return of the murderer. The Targums also explain that Aharon and his sons should be anointed and consecrated to serve as kohanim before God. 

|וְאֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל תְּדַבֵּ֣ר לֵאמֹ֑ר שֶׁ֠מֶן מִשְׁחַת־קֹ֨דֶשׁ יִהְיֶ֥ה זֶ֛ה לִ֖י לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|31|And speak to the Israelite people, as follows: This shall be an anointing oil sacred to Me throughout the ages.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the kegs filled with oil symbolize intellect and wisdom obtained through good deeds and adherence to commandments, allowing the light of the Shechinah to transform darkness into light. The anointing oil made according to Exodus 30:31 was used to anoint High Priests and kings, with the Torah emphasizing its sacred nature and importance of repentance. Halakhah dictates the anointing of High Priests and kings with the specific oil made by Moses, with severe consequences for intentional or unintentional anointing with any other oil. Midrash texts discuss the miracles of the anointing oil and its importance, while Musar highlights peace as a key element in maintaining harmony and the presence of the Shechinah. The Talmud recounts the miraculous properties of the anointing oil made by Moses, its use for anointing various individuals and objects, and its sacred preservation for future generations. Targum texts emphasize the holiness of the anointing oil before God for all generations. 

|עַל־בְּשַׂ֤ר אָדָם֙ לֹ֣א יִיסָ֔ךְ וּ֨בְמַתְכֻּנְתּ֔וֹ לֹ֥א תַעֲשׂ֖וּ כָּמֹ֑הוּ קֹ֣דֶשׁ ה֔וּא קֹ֖דֶשׁ יִהְיֶ֥ה לָכֶֽם׃|32|It must not be rubbed on any person’s body, and you must not make anything like it in the same proportions; it is sacred, to be held sacred by you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the divine soul within man is pure, except for tzaddikim who are identified with their pure divine soul while their body is considered "The flesh of man." Halakhah states that the anointing oil must not be duplicated or applied to unauthorized persons, and only priests can be anointed with it, and it must be prepared with consecrated ingredients in the Sanctuary. Kabbalah teaches that the physical body of man is not his true identity, but rather a garment for the inner aspect of man, which is his intellectual soul. Midrash recounts Moses urging Korah and the Levites to reconsider their rebellion against Aaron's priesthood, highlighting Aaron's humility and piety. Mishnah lists those liable to receive lashes for various offenses, including eating forbidden items. Talmud discusses the application of anointing oil and the liability for different cases, with disagreements among rabbis. Quoting Commentary emphasizes that the anointing oil is meant for anointing high priesthood or kingship, not for strangers, and should not be poured on flesh. Targum reiterates that the anointing oil must not be poured on human flesh and must not be duplicated. 

|אִ֚ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִרְקַ֣ח כָּמֹ֔הוּ וַאֲשֶׁ֥ר יִתֵּ֛ן מִמֶּ֖נּוּ עַל־זָ֑ר וְנִכְרַ֖ת מֵעַמָּֽיו׃|33|Any party who compounds its like, or puts any of it on a lay person, shall be cut off from kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anointing mentioned in the Torah is done with sacred oil to symbolize honor and stature, with severe consequences for unauthorized individuals. Willfully preparing anointing oil or anointing oneself with it leads to liability for karet, while spreading it on non-human entities results in exemption. The Mishnah lists thirty-six cases of intentional prohibited actions leading to karet, including sexual offenses and desecration of Shabbat. The severity of karet is emphasized in cases of blasphemy and misinterpretation of Torah, with some sinners being denied a share in the afterlife. Various prohibitions and punishments, such as eating leavened bread on Passover or performing prohibited labor on Yom Kippur, can result in karet, with certain individuals like High Priests and kings also included in the prohibition of misuse. 

|וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֜ה קַח־לְךָ֣ סַמִּ֗ים נָטָ֤ף ׀ וּשְׁחֵ֙לֶת֙ וְחֶלְבְּנָ֔ה סַמִּ֖ים וּלְבֹנָ֣ה זַכָּ֑ה בַּ֥ד בְּבַ֖ד יִהְיֶֽה׃|34|And יהוה said to Moses: Take the herbs stacte, onycha, and galbanum—these herbs together with pure frankincense; let there be an equal part of each.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The eleven spices of the incense represent sparks of holiness within kelipot, with Torah sections about curtains, incense, blessings, and the Vision of the Chariot mitigating harsh judgments. The spices were to be treated individually before being combined for the incense offering, with specific spices mentioned in the Torah fulfilling a positive commandment in Temple rituals. The incense offering was considered significant, symbolizing atonement, and needing great care in preparation. In the Second Temple, equal parts of sweet spices, oil, and other ingredients were used for the frankincense offering. The Gemara discusses precise requirements for offerings, with linen garments needing to be fine and the eleven spices of the incense being necessary details. Adonoy instructs Moshe to take equal weights of spices including stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense in Exodus 30:34 according to Targum translations. 

|וְעָשִׂ֤יתָ אֹתָהּ֙ קְטֹ֔רֶת רֹ֖קַח מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה רוֹקֵ֑חַ מְמֻלָּ֖ח טָה֥וֹר קֹֽדֶשׁ׃|35|Make them into incense, a compound expertly blended, refined, pure, sacred.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "memulach" in Exodus 30:35 refers to the incense being seasoned with salt from Sodom, thoroughly mixed together to the point that individual ingredients cannot be recognized, and refined to the extent that foreign substances are not present, symbolizing purification and sanctification. The measurement of Melach Sedomit is a quarter of a kab, understood as refined salt. Ibn Ezra and Rashi discuss the use of sweet incense and the meaning of נִמְלָחוּ. The Talmud emphasizes the importance of being industrious and discusses the preparation and use of incense in the Temple. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight the meticulous process of creating a fragrant, pure, and holy incense. 

|וְשָֽׁחַקְתָּ֣ מִמֶּ֘נָּה֮ הָדֵק֒ וְנָתַתָּ֨ה מִמֶּ֜נָּה לִפְנֵ֤י הָעֵדֻת֙ בְּאֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֔ד אֲשֶׁ֛ר אִוָּעֵ֥ד לְךָ֖ שָׁ֑מָּה קֹ֥דֶשׁ קׇֽדָשִׁ֖ים תִּהְיֶ֥ה לָכֶֽם׃|36|Beat some of it into powder, and put some before the Pact in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The regulations for burning incense require daily offerings on the inner altar in the Tent of Meeting, with specific measurements and preparations, including superfine grinding on Yom Kippur. Liturgical texts detail the composition and placement of the incense before the Ark of Testimony, emphasizing its sacred significance. The Talmud explains the High Priest's extra fine grinding of incense on Yom Kippur, in accordance with Torah requirements, while the Targum emphasizes the holiness of the incense placed before God's Word in the Tent of Meeting. 

|וְהַקְּטֹ֙רֶת֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה בְּמַ֨תְכֻּנְתָּ֔הּ לֹ֥א תַעֲשׂ֖וּ לָכֶ֑ם קֹ֛דֶשׁ תִּהְיֶ֥ה לְךָ֖ לַיהֹוָֽה׃|37|But when you make this incense, you must not make any in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be held by you sacred to יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits duplicating the composition of the incense offering, with severe penalties for those who violate this commandment. The Mishnah lists various actions that warrant lashes, including consuming untithed produce and eating sacrificial food while ritually impure. Commandment 111 prohibits using the same ingredients or quantities as prescribed in the Torah for the incense offering for private purposes. The Gemara discusses the sacred nature of incense preparation in the Temple, emphasizing that it must be prepared specifically for the Temple and not for personal use. 

|אִ֛ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֥ה כָמ֖וֹהָ לְהָרִ֣יחַ בָּ֑הּ וְנִכְרַ֖ת מֵעַמָּֽיו׃|38|Any party who makes any like it, to smell of it, shall be cut off from kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, reciting the Torah section on the Temple incense-offering is seen as a rectification for slander. The Lord warns against replicating the sacred perfume, with severe consequences for those who do so. The Mishnah lists thirty-six transgressions punishable by karet, including improper use of anointing oil and incense. The Gemara debates whether the smell of incense is subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property, with different opinions on the matter. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that replicating the incense formula for personal enjoyment will result in being spiritually cut off from the community.

## Exodus 31

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|1|יהוה spoke to Moses:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Bezalel and Oholiab were chosen to construct the tabernacle due to their exceptional artistic skills, not their lineage or resemblance to lions, as suggested by Saadiah Gaon. God chose Bezalel from the beginning of time to build the Sanctuary, as he saw that Israel would accept the Torah. The half shekel coin was to atone for the Israelites not destroying the golden calf, with Rabbi Akiva interpreting "boshesh" as midday when Moses came down from the mountain. Rabbi Yoḥanan states that three matters are proclaimed by God Himself: famine, plenty, and a good leader, with biblical sources cited for each. Both Targums Onkelos and Jonathan state that Adonoy spoke to Moshe. 

|רְאֵ֖ה קָרָ֣אתִֽי בְשֵׁ֑ם בְּצַלְאֵ֛ל בֶּן־אוּרִ֥י בֶן־ח֖וּר לְמַטֵּ֥ה יְהוּדָֽה׃|2|See, I have singled out by name Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Betzalel was chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle due to his exceptional skills and divine wisdom, fulfilling a sacred purpose. The Sages defined "labor" in the construction of the Tabernacle as thirty-nine activities, influencing the forbidden labors on Shabbat. Akeidat Yitzchak raises questions about the Jewish people's complaints in the desert, Moses' actions, and God's detailed awareness of human actions. Bezalel's perfection is exemplified in Kabbalistic teachings, while Midrash highlights his wisdom in discerning the order of construction based on God's instructions. Various commentators emphasize the significance of Bezalel's appointment by God for building the Tabernacle, showcasing his wisdom and skill. Rabbi Yoḥanan discusses matters proclaimed by God Himself, including famine, plenty, a good leader, the sword, and those who escape the sword. Targum translations of Exodus 31:2 highlight Bezalel's exalted status and good name as designated by God. 

|וָאֲמַלֵּ֥א אֹת֖וֹ ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֑ים בְּחׇכְמָ֛ה וּבִתְבוּנָ֥ה וּבְדַ֖עַת וּבְכׇל־מְלָאכָֽה׃|3|I have endowed him with a divine spirit of skill, ability, and knowledge in every kind of craft;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the mentalities of wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and craft correspond to God's Name and are related to the construction of the Holy Temple, leading to contemplation of the Lord and attributes like love and awe. Commentary highlights Bezalel's intelligence and skills, while Jewish Thought expands on artistic and prophetic inspiration. Kabbalah discusses the importance of knowledge as a decisor between wisdom and understanding, and Midrash connects wisdom, understanding, and knowledge to the creation of the world and the Tabernacle. Musar compares the Tabernacle's construction to the universe's creation, and Second Temple commentary emphasizes the divine spirit of wisdom and understanding in Bezalel. Talmud and Targum affirm Bezalel's knowledge of the letters of creation and divine inspiration. 

|לַחְשֹׁ֖ב מַחֲשָׁבֹ֑ת לַעֲשׂ֛וֹת בַּזָּהָ֥ב וּבַכֶּ֖סֶף וּבַנְּחֹֽשֶׁת׃|4|to make designs for work in gold, silver, and copper,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi and Steinsaltz explain that in Exodus 31:4, "to devise devices" refers to skilled metalwork for the Tabernacle. Betzalel embodies the Divine creativity of humanity, connecting Torah to action and prayer. In Kabbalah, the letters of the Torah are connected to the Lower Shekhinah. The construction of the Tabernacle mirrors the universe's creation, emphasizing the importance of contemplating commandments. The Talmud exempts forming a pile on Shabbat as it is not considered prohibited labor, while peeling barley is considered creative work but collecting it in one's hand is not. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret the passage as teaching craftsmanship with gold, silver, and copper, emphasizing the importance of careful thought in the work. 

|וּבַחֲרֹ֥שֶׁת אֶ֛בֶן לְמַלֹּ֖את וּבַחֲרֹ֣שֶׁת עֵ֑ץ לַעֲשׂ֖וֹת בְּכׇל־מְלָאכָֽה׃|5|to cut stones for setting and to carve wood—to work in every kind of craft.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "חרשת" denotes artisanship generally, with Onkelos specifying the term in Exodus 31:5, while Ramban interprets "avnei milu’im" as stones for filling-in the settings of the ephod and breastplate, disagreeing with Rashi. Steinsaltz adds that the artisan must be skilled in cutting precious stones for setting and carving wood for the Tabernacle and its vessels. In the world to come, souls experience elevation, refinement, and purity beyond human comprehension, with a way of taking delight deeper than any measure. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the tasks of cutting precious stones for setting, carving wood, and working in various types of crafting. 

|וַאֲנִ֞י הִנֵּ֧ה נָתַ֣תִּי אִתּ֗וֹ אֵ֣ת אׇהֳלִיאָ֞ב בֶּן־אֲחִֽיסָמָךְ֙ לְמַטֵּה־דָ֔ן וּבְלֵ֥ב כׇּל־חֲכַם־לֵ֖ב נָתַ֣תִּי חׇכְמָ֑ה וְעָשׂ֕וּ אֵ֖ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּיתִֽךָ׃|6|Moreover, I have assigned to him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have also granted skill to all who are skillful, that they may make everything that I have commanded you:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Betzalel, skilled in crafting the Tabernacle, was aided by Oholiav to show equality among tribes. Prophets are chosen based on their closeness to God, with prophecy requiring physical strength. Bezalel's wisdom allowed him to question the order of building the Mishkan, and God grants wisdom to those who already possess some. Dan and Judah had a significant partnership in building the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Abbahu explain that wisdom is granted to those who already possess it. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Oholiav serving alongside Bezalel with wisdom from God. 

|אֵ֣ת ׀ אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֗ד וְאֶת־הָֽאָרֹן֙ לָֽעֵדֻ֔ת וְאֶת־הַכַּפֹּ֖רֶת אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָלָ֑יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־כְּלֵ֥י הָאֹֽהֶל׃|7|the Tent of Meeting, the Ark for the Pact and the cover upon it, and all the furnishings of the Tent;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz emphasize the importance of the tent of meeting, the ark, and other vessels in the tabernacle, specifically noting the significance of the ark for holding the tablets of the testimony. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony, and other furniture of the Tabernacle in Exodus 31:7. 

|וְאֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָן֙ וְאֶת־כֵּלָ֔יו וְאֶת־הַמְּנֹרָ֥ה הַטְּהֹרָ֖ה וְאֶת־כׇּל־כֵּלֶ֑יהָ וְאֵ֖ת מִזְבַּ֥ח הַקְּטֹֽרֶת׃|8|the table and its utensils, the pure lampstand  and all its fittings, and the altar of incense;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The candelabrum in the Tabernacle is called טהרה because it is made of pure gold, while the other vessels are not impure but not as refined. The term "the pure one" is added to the candlestick and table in Leviticus 24:6 as they never had blood sprinkled on them. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda's opinion in Kiddushin 19a:10 discusses the requirement for there to be enough time remaining in the day for redemption if a woman is designated for redemption at the end of her service. The lamps on the pure lampstand are to be set up before יהוה to burn regularly, and the showbread is to be placed on the pure table before יהוה in two rows, six to a row. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the Table and its vessels, the Menorah and its vessels, and the Incense Altar in Exodus 31:8. 

|וְאֶת־מִזְבַּ֥ח הָעֹלָ֖ה וְאֶת־כׇּל־כֵּלָ֑יו וְאֶת־הַכִּיּ֖וֹר וְאֶת־כַּנּֽוֹ׃|9|the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Steinsaltz emphasizes the significance of the altar of the burnt offering, its vessels, the basin, and its base in the Tabernacle's structure and service, as mentioned in Exodus 31:9. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also highlight these components in their commentaries on the same verse. 

|וְאֵ֖ת בִּגְדֵ֣י הַשְּׂרָ֑ד וְאֶת־בִּגְדֵ֤י הַקֹּ֙דֶשׁ֙ לְאַהֲרֹ֣ן הַכֹּהֵ֔ן וְאֶת־בִּגְדֵ֥י בָנָ֖יו לְכַהֵֽן׃|10|the service  vestments, the sacral vestments of Aaron the priest and the vestments of his sons, for their service as priests;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The garments of 'ha'srod' in Exodus 31:10 were woven covers for the Tabernacle furnishings during travel, not priestly garments, possibly symbolizing distinction and royalty. The term 'ha'srod' may refer to unique garments of the High Priest. The census in Numbers 4 detailed the responsibilities of the Kohathites, Gershonites, and Merarites among the Levites in service to the Tent of Meeting. The Targum mentions the making of crochet-work garments for Aharon the priest and his sons for their ministry. 

|וְאֵ֨ת שֶׁ֧מֶן הַמִּשְׁחָ֛ה וְאֶת־קְטֹ֥רֶת הַסַּמִּ֖ים לַקֹּ֑דֶשׁ כְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוִּיתִ֖ךָ יַעֲשֽׂוּ׃|11|as well as the anointing oil and the aromatic incense for the sanctuary. Just as I have commanded you, they shall do.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The materials mentioned in Exodus 31:11 were designated for exclusive use in the holy place, emphasizing their sacred purpose and the need for specific expertise in their preparation and use. Jewish people maintain a connection with God through practices like circumcision, Sabbath observance, and adherence to the covenant, despite their spiritual weakness. Rabbi Yossi explains that incense must be offered within the sanctuary, not on the outer altar. Bezalel and Oholiav are skilled craftsmen tasked with constructing what Moses has been shown, including the garments of the High Priest. Bezalel's wisdom allowed him to intuitively understand God's commands and construct the tabernacle correctly. The Talmud discusses rules for burning incense on altars, emphasizing the importance of following precise instructions. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the anointing oil and incense for the Holy Sanctuary, stressing the importance of following God's commands. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|12|And יהוה said to Moses:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Observing the Sabbath in Chasidut involves preparation throughout the week to experience spiritual benefits, with a focus on both spiritual and material aspects. The Sabbath offers forgiveness for sins and spiritual therapy, emphasizing giving to God rather than receiving. In the commentary, Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, and Rav Hirsch discuss different aspects of Moses receiving instructions from God regarding Sabbath observance. Ramban explains the limitation of atonement on the Day of Atonement to those who repent. Rebbi Abbahu explains that danger to life allows for setting aside the Sabbath, based on Exodus 31:12. Adonoy communicated with Moses in the Targum. 

|וְאַתָּ֞ה דַּבֵּ֨ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַ֥ךְ אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֖י תִּשְׁמֹ֑רוּ כִּי֩ א֨וֹת הִ֜וא בֵּינִ֤י וּבֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ לְדֹרֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם לָדַ֕עַת כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה מְקַדִּשְׁכֶֽם׃|13|Speak to the Israelite people and say: Nevertheless, you must keep My sabbaths, for this is a sign between Me and you throughout the ages, that you may know that I יהוה have consecrated you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various interpretations of the significance of Shabbat are discussed, emphasizing its role as a sign of the connection between God and the Jewish people that elevates one's connection to the divine. Shabbat is linked to the creation of the world and the inner essence of all actions, remaining pure and sustaining life even after the sin of the Golden Calf. Observing Shabbat is considered equivalent to observing all the mitzvot of the Torah, and it is suspended in cases of danger to life. The Sabbath is a time of rest symbolizing a return to the source of life and true rest, with its observance being a sign between God and the Jewish people. 

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת כִּ֛י קֹ֥דֶשׁ הִ֖וא לָכֶ֑ם מְחַֽלְלֶ֙יהָ֙ מ֣וֹת יוּמָ֔ת כִּ֗י כׇּל־הָעֹשֶׂ֥ה בָהּ֙ מְלָאכָ֔ה וְנִכְרְתָ֛ה הַנֶּ֥פֶשׁ הַהִ֖וא מִקֶּ֥רֶב עַמֶּֽיהָ׃|14|You shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy for you. One who profanes it shall be put to death: whoever does work on it, that person shall be cut off from among kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the joy and satisfaction in causing God pleasure, while the importance of observing the Sabbath is highlighted in various commentaries, emphasizing the sanctity and consequences of desecrating it. The Babylonian Talmud discusses the severity of Sabbath violations compared to Festivals, while Halakhah outlines punishments for intentional desecration. Jewish Thought emphasizes saving lives over observing Shabbat laws, and Kabbalah stresses the importance of maintaining holiness and unity. Midrash warns of consequences for neglecting Torah study, Mishnah lists actions resulting in excision, and Musar expresses concern over disregard for Torah and mitzvot. Quoting Commentary discusses the significance of first fruits and the Sabbath, and Talmud explores punishments for transgressions. Targum emphasizes the sacredness of Shabbat and the consequences for desecration. 

|שֵׁ֣שֶׁת יָמִים֮ יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה מְלָאכָה֒ וּבַיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֗י שַׁבַּ֧ת שַׁבָּת֛וֹן קֹ֖דֶשׁ לַיהֹוָ֑ה כׇּל־הָעֹשֶׂ֧ה מְלָאכָ֛ה בְּי֥וֹם הַשַּׁבָּ֖ת מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת׃|15|Six days may work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a sabbath of complete rest, holy to יהוה; whoever does work on the sabbath day shall be put to death.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of longing and anticipation for Shabbos, connecting with its sanctity throughout the week. Various commentaries explore the laws and significance of observing the Sabbath, including prohibitions on commerce and labor, with additional ordinances established by the Sages. The Midrash and liturgy highlight the covenantal nature of the Sabbath and the creation of the world through the Word and Torah. Rabbeinu Bahya and other commentators delve into the completion of creation and the foundation of the universe represented by the Sabbath. In the Talmud, different schools debate the punishment for transgressions on Yom Kippur. Targum emphasizes the sacredness of Shabbos and the punishment for working on that day. 

|וְשָׁמְר֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֑ת לַעֲשׂ֧וֹת אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֛ת לְדֹרֹתָ֖ם בְּרִ֥ית עוֹלָֽם׃|16|The Israelite people shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath throughout the ages as a covenant for all time:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of Sabbath observance for bringing about the messianic age and connecting with God, while Halakhah discusses the exceptions for violating Shabbat to save a life. Jewish Thought explores the transformation of pleasure and sanctification of the soul through Sabbath observance, and Kabbalah delves into the spiritual significance of safeguarding Shabbat. Liturgy references the commandment to rest on the Sabbath, while Midrash discusses the covenant between God and the children of Israel linked to Sabbath observance. Quoting Commentary highlights various interpretations and customs related to the Sabbath, and Talmud compares the observance of Shabbat to the covenant of circumcision. Tanakh mentions the requirement for circumcision as part of the covenant between God and Abraham, and Targum emphasizes the everlasting covenant of Sabbath observance for the Children of Israel. 

|בֵּינִ֗י וּבֵין֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל א֥וֹת הִ֖וא לְעֹלָ֑ם כִּי־שֵׁ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים עָשָׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־הַשָּׁמַ֣יִם וְאֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ וּבַיּוֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י שָׁבַ֖ת וַיִּנָּפַֽשׁ׃|17|it shall be a sign for all time between Me and the people of Israel. For in six days יהוה made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day [God] ceased from work and was refreshed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of the Sabbath in Judaism revolves around the additional soul present during that time, symbolizing the covenant between God and the Children of Israel, with emphasis on rest, spiritual rejuvenation, and partnership with God in creation. The Sabbath serves as a sign of the relationship and covenant between the Jewish people and God, highlighting the importance of spiritual pursuits over transient values and the observance of laws governing its use. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֣ן אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה כְּכַלֹּתוֹ֙ לְדַבֵּ֤ר אִתּוֹ֙ בְּהַ֣ר סִינַ֔י שְׁנֵ֖י לֻחֹ֣ת הָעֵדֻ֑ת לֻחֹ֣ת אֶ֔בֶן כְּתֻבִ֖ים בְּאֶצְבַּ֥ע אֱלֹהִֽים׃|18|Upon finishing speaking with him on Mount Sinai, [God] gave Moses the two tablets of the Pact, stone tablets inscribed with the finger of God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan 65:9:3, the "point with his finger" symbolizes the Torah as an aspect of "the finger of God," while in Sefat Emet, Moses' intense effort for forty days before receiving the Torah as a gift from Hashem is highlighted. The Torah uses expressions like "below His feet," "written by the finger of God," "God's hand," "God's eyes," and "God's ears" metaphorically, reflecting human thought processes. The text explains that phrases like "written by the finger of God" and "written by the word of God" are interchangeable, symbolizing creation through speech, while Kabbalah discusses the divine encounter with She adorned in three colors representing the three colors of Her eyes. Midrash delves into the Israelites' actions with the golden calf, and Musar touches on Rashi's disagreement with the Zohar on the timing of donations for the Tabernacle. The Talmud discusses the permissibility of moving items in a house, and Targum describes Adonoy giving Moses two stone tablets written by God's finger on Mount Sinai.

## Exodus 32

|וַיַּ֣רְא הָעָ֔ם כִּֽי־בֹשֵׁ֥שׁ מֹשֶׁ֖ה לָרֶ֣דֶת מִן־הָהָ֑ר וַיִּקָּהֵ֨ל הָעָ֜ם עַֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן וַיֹּאמְר֤וּ אֵלָיו֙ ק֣וּם ׀ עֲשֵׂה־לָ֣נוּ אֱלֹהִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֤ר יֵֽלְכוּ֙ לְפָנֵ֔ינוּ כִּי־זֶ֣ה ׀ מֹשֶׁ֣ה הָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱלָ֙נוּ֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם לֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְנוּ מֶה־הָ֥יָה לֽוֹ׃|1|When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, the people gathered against Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who shall go before us, for that fellow Moses—the man who brought us from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has happened to him.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the sin of the golden calf was a result of the Israelites' misunderstanding of Moses' absence, as they wanted a leader, not a new deity. Halakhah discusses the spiritual reward of the Garden of Eden for fulfilling mitzvot, while Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of God's presence for the Jews to be distinguished from other nations. Kabbalah connects the sin of the golden calf to the separation between the sixth and seventh millennia, and Midrash explains how the Israelites were punished and comforted through their senses. Musar highlights the restoration of the Israelites' connection with Sinai and Torah through repentance and the counting of half-shekels. Quoting Commentary clarifies that the plague after the golden calf incident was a partial punishment, and Talmud discusses the misunderstanding that led to the creation of idols. Tanakh contrasts the negative gathering around the golden calf with the positive assembly by Moses in Vayakhel, emphasizing the importance of coming together under God's guidance. Targum explains that the people asked Aaron to make gods due to their uncertainty about Moses' fate, influenced by Satana. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ אַהֲרֹ֔ן פָּֽרְקוּ֙ נִזְמֵ֣י הַזָּהָ֔ב אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י נְשֵׁיכֶ֔ם בְּנֵיכֶ֖ם וּבְנֹתֵיכֶ֑ם וְהָבִ֖יאוּ אֵלָֽי׃|2|Aaron said to them, “[You men,] take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron delayed the construction of the golden calf until Moses returned, choosing gold over silver for its symbolic significance. The commandment to follow the majority opinion is derived from Exodus 32:2, except in the case of the Sanhedrin. The Midrash praises the daughters of Zelophehad for their wisdom and righteousness, contrasting with the women of Moav engaged in idolatry. Jewish women were the first to donate for the construction of the Tabernacle, receiving special credit for their contributions. The calf made from women's earrings symbolizes the difference between manufactured gods and the true God. Aharon instructed the people to bring golden rings from their wives' ears, as mentioned in both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan commentaries. 

|וַיִּתְפָּֽרְקוּ֙ כׇּל־הָעָ֔ם אֶת־נִזְמֵ֥י הַזָּהָ֖ב אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּאׇזְנֵיהֶ֑ם וַיָּבִ֖יאוּ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹֽן׃|3|And all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Exodus 32:3, Ibn Ezra explains that "all the people" refers to sons, daughters, and wives, as adult males did not wear rings in their ears. Rashi clarifies that the term "ויתפרקו" denotes unloading a burden, and "את נזמי" means "מן נזמי." Siftei Chakhamim agrees with Rashi's explanation, adding that the reflexive verb form indicates that they unloaded themselves. Steinsaltz simply states that all the people removed their gold rings and brought them to Aaron. The people generously donated their earrings to Aharon for the construction of the Mishkan, demonstrating their commitment to the project and their willingness to contribute to the community (Shemot 32:3). Rashi explains that the red cow was to be paid for by the people to atone for the sin of the golden calf, symbolizing the unblemished state of the Jewish nation prior to the sin. The red cow ritual parallels the sprinkling of ash and water done by Moses after the golden calf incident. Onkelos translates the punishment for those who "made" the calf as those who embraced and kissed it, not for those who worshipped it. The plague sent upon Israel after Moses' prayer was partially to blot out their sin and show mercy, allowing them to eventually enter the promised land. Rebbi Mana explains that lighting fire is mentioned unnecessarily in the Talmud, while prostrating oneself is mentioned by necessity. Sacrificing is mentioned separately to teach about everything, and prostrating oneself is mentioned to explain itself. Rebbi Jeremiah adds that lighting fire was mentioned to teach that courts should not sit on the Sabbath, based on the mention of "settlements" in the Torah. 

|וַיִּקַּ֣ח מִיָּדָ֗ם וַיָּ֤צַר אֹתוֹ֙ בַּחֶ֔רֶט וַֽיַּעֲשֵׂ֖הוּ עֵ֣גֶל מַסֵּכָ֑ה וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶעֱל֖וּךָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|4|This he took from them and cast in a mold,  and made it into a molten calf. And they exclaimed, “This is your god,  O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the role of hands in idolatry and how the sin of worshipping the golden calf led to the Israelites' desert journeys, serving as atonement. The commentary explains that the calf was not intended as an idol but as a representation of divine power, with Aaron's actions motivated by a desire to protect the people. The Talmud discusses the Jewish people's idolatry with the Golden Calf, noting their desire for multiple gods and the importance of Torah study to avoid negative consequences. Aaron did not make the calf on his own, but the people gathered around him and demanded it. Tanakh references instances of golden calf worship in I Kings, Nehemiah, and Zechariah, while both Targums describe Aaron making the calf from the Israelites' earrings. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַיִּ֥בֶן מִזְבֵּ֖חַ לְפָנָ֑יו וַיִּקְרָ֤א אַֽהֲרֹן֙ וַיֹּאמַ֔ר חַ֥ג לַיהֹוָ֖ה מָחָֽר׃|5|When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron announced: “Tomorrow shall be a festival of יהוה!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The fifteenth of Av was a joyous holiday for Israel, possibly linked to the festival of the Lord in Shilo, meant to bring freedom and inscription of the Torah into the hearts of Israelites. Aaron's actions with the golden calf were intended to honor God and prevent idolatry, not out of fear for his life. Judaism struggled with strict monotheism, seeking mediators like Elohim. After the Ninth of Av, one is permitted to do anything, and Aaron's involvement in the incident did not make him guilty of idolatry. Aaron built an altar after seeing Hur slain and fearing for his own life, and various Sages disagree on the interpretation of Psalms 10:3 in relation to the Golden Calf incident. 

|וַיַּשְׁכִּ֙ימוּ֙ מִֽמׇּחֳרָ֔ת וַיַּעֲל֣וּ עֹלֹ֔ת וַיַּגִּ֖שׁוּ שְׁלָמִ֑ים וַיֵּ֤שֶׁב הָעָם֙ לֶֽאֱכֹ֣ל וְשָׁת֔וֹ וַיָּקֻ֖מוּ לְצַחֵֽק׃|6|Early next day, the people offered up burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; they sat down to eat and drink, and then rose to dance.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sin of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32:1-6 highlights the danger of material possessions becoming objects of worship, leading to collective folly and the need for atonement on Yom Kippur. Aaron's weakness in allowing the creation of the calf is likened to the madness of crowds and idolatry throughout history. The text discusses the commandment of sanctifying the moon and the ceremonies associated with it, emphasizing that no heavenly body has dominion over the Jewish people. In the Kabbalistic text Zohar, the Shechinah is said to be with Rivkah, and questions arise about Isaac's holiness and marital relations during the daytime. Sarah's expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael is attributed to Ishmael's engagement in idol worship or sexual immorality in the Midrash. The sins of robbery, sexual aberrations, and slander are present during the episode of the Golden Calf and in the encounter between the serpent and man in the Garden of Eden, leading to a withholding of abundance from God. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה לֶךְ־רֵ֕ד כִּ֚י שִׁחֵ֣ת עַמְּךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶעֱלֵ֖יתָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|7|יהוה spoke to Moses, “Hurry down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have acted basely.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Moses' plea for forgiveness for the Jewish people after the sin of the golden calf, highlighting the impact of the people's corruption and idol worship on his spiritual level. Halakhah discusses the criteria for animals to be acceptable as sacrifices, focusing on their purity and adherence to specific guidelines. Jewish Thought explores various teachings found in the Talmud, covering practical instructions, character types, and reflections on Moses' importance. Kabbalah delves into Moses' attempt to bring proselytes under the Shechinah's wings and the consequences of their actions on his spiritual level. Midrash depicts Moses grappling with divine anger and rage, seeking protection from the Holy One.

They have made themselves a molten calf and bowed low to it and sacrificed to it, saying: ‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!’”|

|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites are depicted as stiff-necked and stubborn, leading to idol worship and disobedience to God's commands. Despite Moses' pleas for mercy and intercession, their behavior will result in punishment and a lack of hope for repentance. The Midrash discusses Israel's faithfulness and God's redemption despite future sins, highlighting the importance of forgiveness and repentance. The root of heresy and destructive actions is attributed to bad character traits, with idolatry seen as a manifestation of these traits. The Tanakh recounts the Israelites' quick turn to idol worship with the Golden Calf, angering God and highlighting their stiff-necked nature. The Targum emphasizes the people's pride and stubbornness as observed by the Lord. 

|וְעַתָּה֙ הַנִּ֣יחָה לִּ֔י וְיִֽחַר־אַפִּ֥י בָהֶ֖ם וַאֲכַלֵּ֑ם וְאֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה אוֹתְךָ֖ לְג֥וֹי גָּדֽוֹל׃|10|Now, let Me be, that My anger may blaze forth against them and that I may destroy them, and make of you a great nation.”|

Rabbi Menachem, Rabbi Hunna, and Rabbi Chiyah address reward and punishment in the Parshah, the spies' mission, and the punishment of the Israelites for disloyalty. Kabbalistic teachings discuss the quality of "Who-Mee-מי" and the righteous' ability to nullify decrees. Various prayers from Siddurim beseech God for forgiveness and protection, expressing trust in His compassion. Moses's powerful prayers spare the Israelites from destruction, preventing the desecration of God's name among the nations. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of God showing mercy instead of harm to His people to avoid a negative perception from Egypt. 

|זְכֹ֡ר לְאַבְרָהָם֩ לְיִצְחָ֨ק וּלְיִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל עֲבָדֶ֗יךָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֣עְתָּ לָהֶם֮ בָּךְ֒ וַתְּדַבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם אַרְבֶּה֙ אֶֽת־זַרְעֲכֶ֔ם כְּכוֹכְבֵ֖י הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם וְכׇל־הָאָ֨רֶץ הַזֹּ֜את אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָמַ֗רְתִּי אֶתֵּן֙ לְזַרְעֲכֶ֔ם וְנָחֲל֖וּ לְעֹלָֽם׃|13|Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, how You swore to them by Your Self and said to them: I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and I will give to your offspring this whole land of which I spoke, to possess forever.”|

Moses appeals to God based on the merit and promises made to the Patriarchs, emphasizing their righteousness and the eternal nature of the inheritance and mercy promised to their descendants. The prayers of Moses and Solomon highlight the importance of invoking the merit of the patriarchs for forgiveness and protection, as seen in the Talmud and Musar teachings. The mention of the patriarchs in prayer is significant and effective, reminding God of His promises and securing forgiveness for the Israelites. 

|וַיִּנָּ֖חֶם יְהֹוָ֑ה עַל־הָ֣רָעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֖ר לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת לְעַמּֽוֹ׃|14|And יהוה renounced the punishment planned for God’s people.|

|וַיִּ֜פֶן וַיֵּ֤רֶד מֹשֶׁה֙ מִן־הָהָ֔ר וּשְׁנֵ֛י לֻחֹ֥ת הָעֵדֻ֖ת בְּיָד֑וֹ לֻחֹ֗ת כְּתֻבִים֙ מִשְּׁנֵ֣י עֶבְרֵיהֶ֔ם מִזֶּ֥ה וּמִזֶּ֖ה הֵ֥ם כְּתֻבִֽים׃|15|Thereupon Moses turned and went down from the mountain bearing the two tablets of the Pact, tablets inscribed on both their surfaces: they were inscribed on the one side and on the other.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the tablets of the testimony represent the power of the Torah to change hearts, symbolizing a unity of wisdom and sacred service engraved on the hearts of Israelites to repair the world. Moses' descent with the tablets showcased the divine origin of the law, accessible to all. Jewish Thought emphasizes the desire for closeness with God through sacrifices, while Kabbalah discusses the symbolism of the Divine Feminine. Midrash recounts stories related to Solomon, the Daughter of Pharaoh, and the tablets inscribed on both sides, connecting them to writing the Torah in various languages. Various interpretations of specific verbs and terms are provided by Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, Ibn Ezra, and Derekh Chayyim. In the Talmud, different opinions on how the tablets were written are presented, with comparisons to waves in the sea. The Targum describes Moshe descending with the two Tablets of the Testimony, inscribed on both sides. 

|וְהַ֨לֻּחֹ֔ת מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים הֵ֑מָּה וְהַמִּכְתָּ֗ב מִכְתַּ֤ב אֱלֹהִים֙ ה֔וּא חָר֖וּת עַל־הַלֻּחֹֽת׃|16|The tablets were God’s work, and the writing was God’s writing, incised upon the tablets.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the significance of the Torah's revealed and hidden teachings, the performance of mitzvot embodying internal Kindnesses, the dwelling of the Shechinah in the Ten Commandments, the holiday of the fifteenth of Av, and the symbolism of the shofar of Rosh Hashanah. Halakhah relates the five senses to the Torah, the design of human beings, and their connection to God.

Kabbalah links holiness to freedom, creation, and the yoke of Heaven. Midrash emphasizes the significance of the Tablets of the Covenant and the importance of Torah study. Mishnah highlights the heavenly proclamation lamenting neglect of Torah study, the tablets representing freedom, and the elevation of those who engage in Torah study. Musar delves into Moses accepting the mixed multitude, the firstborn status of the Levites, repentance, and the importance of following the commandments. Quoting Commentary reflects on the Israelites' betrayal of their relationship with G'd. Second Temple discusses Aaron's rod swallowing the sorcerers' rods and the tablets representing the rational and irrational parts of the soul. Talmud emphasizes the importance of Torah study, the significance of the first tablets, and warnings against heresy. Targum highlights the divine nature of the Tablets, while Tosefta provides guidelines for good relationships and wisdom. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֧ע יְהוֹשֻׁ֛עַ אֶת־ק֥וֹל הָעָ֖ם בְּרֵעֹ֑ה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה ק֥וֹל מִלְחָמָ֖ה בַּֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|17|When Joshua heard the sound of the people in its boisterousness, he said to Moses, “There is a cry of war in the camp.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses broke the tablets upon seeing the Israelites worship the Golden Calf, burned it, tested the people with its ashes, and punished the worshipers. In Akeidat Yitzchak, Moses and the nobles gained deep insights into the Divine mind, with Moses meeting God alone on the mountain. Rabbi Elazar discusses Joshua hearing evil in the camp, symbolizing war. In Midrash, tithing transforms curses into blessings, and biblical figures are compared for their qualities. The phrase "Nor is the battle to the strong" refers to the sense of hearing in war. Moses gave Joshua his name as a prayer against evil counsel and relied on prayer for the Israelites' lack of skill in warfare. Moses broke the tablets after visually confirming the people's idolatry, and Targum specifies the people's actions as evil. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אֵ֥ין קוֹל֙ עֲנ֣וֹת גְּבוּרָ֔ה וְאֵ֥ין ק֖וֹל עֲנ֣וֹת חֲלוּשָׁ֑ה ק֣וֹל עַנּ֔וֹת אָנֹכִ֖י שֹׁמֵֽעַ׃|18|But he answered, “It is not the sound of the tune of triumph, Or the sound of the tune of defeat; It is the sound of song that I hear!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of rectifying the sounds related to victory and defeat within oneself through prayer and focus on Torah, while the commentary highlights Moses' reliance on sight over hearing in reacting to the Golden Calf incident. Kabbalah discusses the significance of crying out to God daily, connecting distress to the Shekhinah's cry for help, and the Midrash explores shame in performing acts of righteousness and the power of tithing. Quoting various commentators, the text delves into the significance of specific words and actions in different biblical contexts. The Talmud recounts Moses' actions leading to the breaking of the tablets, and Targum distinguishes the unique sound of those serving before the Golden Calf. 

|וַֽיְהִ֗י כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר קָרַב֙ אֶל־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וַיַּ֥רְא אֶת־הָעֵ֖גֶל וּמְחֹלֹ֑ת וַיִּֽחַר־אַ֣ף מֹשֶׁ֗ה וַיַּשְׁלֵ֤ךְ מִיָּדָו֙ אֶת־הַלֻּחֹ֔ת וַיְשַׁבֵּ֥ר אֹתָ֖ם תַּ֥חַת הָהָֽר׃|19|As soon as Moses came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he became enraged; and he hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Moshe broke the luchos to show solidarity with Bnei Yisrael and repair their sin by remaining connected to them, while Commentary suggests that Moshe broke the tablets as a witness to the tearing of the covenant due to the people's revelry over the calf. Halakhah lists fast days commemorating the breaking of the Tablets among other tragedies, while Jewish Thought explores the meanings of karab, naga‘, and nagash in relation to physical nearness or knowledge. Kabbalah symbolizes the written Torah with two arms represented by the tablets given to Moses. Midrash confirms Moses' judgment and actions after the sin of the Golden Calf were in accordance with divine will, with various commentaries discussing Moses' prayer, joy of festivals, and reasons for breaking the tablets. Second Temple texts warn against indulgence in worldly pleasures symbolized by the Golden Calf, while Talmud states that Moses broke the tablets on the seventeenth of Tammuz after seeing the people worship the calf. Targum describes Moshe's anger at the calf and dancing, leading him to smash the Tablets in response to the people's idolatry. 

|וַיִּקַּ֞ח אֶת־הָעֵ֨גֶל אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשׂוּ֙ וַיִּשְׂרֹ֣ף בָּאֵ֔שׁ וַיִּטְחַ֖ן עַ֣ד אֲשֶׁר־דָּ֑ק וַיִּ֙זֶר֙ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י הַמַּ֔יִם וַיַּ֖שְׁקְ אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|20|He took the calf that they had made and burned it; he ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and so made the Israelites drink it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the concept of overflowing abundance through trials, referencing Psalms 66:12 and the story of the Golden Calf in Exodus 32:20. Moses ground the golden calf into powder, scattered it on water, and made the Israelites drink it to shame their idolatry, test their faithfulness, and potentially punish the guilty. The Midrash highlights Moses' leadership, prayerfulness, and role as a mediator, emphasizing his commitment to justice and God's will. The Mishnah specifies which Torah incidents are read in public and translated, while the Talmud discusses methods of disposing of idols and the guilt-testing process. In Numbers 5:11-31, a ritual for a jealous husband to determine his wife's faithfulness is described, and in Deuteronomy 9:21, Moses destroys the golden calf. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֔ן מֶֽה־עָשָׂ֥ה לְךָ֖ הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֑ה כִּֽי־הֵבֵ֥אתָ עָלָ֖יו חֲטָאָ֥ה גְדֹלָֽה׃|21|Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought such great sin upon them?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron explains to Moses that he did not physically make the golden calf, but rather threw gold into the crucible, and the calf emerged on its own. Moses questions whether Aaron was pressured into complying with the sin, and Aaron clarifies the circumstances that led to the idol's creation. The Midrash teaches not to condemn anyone without personal investigation, even if the information comes from God, and Moses burned the platform for the golden calf, not the calf itself. The severe judgments against Israel were due to the hatred they caused between themselves and God, with Aaron's fear for his life contributing to his actions with the Golden Calf. The Talmud states that the incident of the Golden Calf, Aaron's account of what happened, and the second narrative of the Golden Calf are read but not translated to prevent denigration of individuals. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אַהֲרֹ֔ן אַל־יִ֥חַר אַ֖ף אֲדֹנִ֑י אַתָּה֙ יָדַ֣עְתָּ אֶת־הָעָ֔ם כִּ֥י בְרָ֖ע הֽוּא׃|22|Aaron said, “Let not my lord be enraged. You know that this people is bent on evil.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron made the golden calf at the request of the people while Moses was away, referring to him as "my lord" out of respect. Various commentaries discuss the significance of Aaron's address to Moses, with some suggesting it was a strategic acknowledgment of Moses' superiority. The Talmud criticizes Aaron's leadership in the incident, highlighting his incompetence and the shame of the public. In the Targum, Aaron asks Moses not to be angry, explaining that the people have evil desires despite being children of God. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמְרוּ לִ֔י עֲשֵׂה־לָ֣נוּ אֱלֹהִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֵלְכ֖וּ לְפָנֵ֑ינוּ כִּי־זֶ֣ה ׀ מֹשֶׁ֣ה הָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱלָ֙נוּ֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם לֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְנוּ מֶה־הָ֥יָה לֽוֹ׃|23|They said to me, ‘Make us a god to lead us; for that fellow Moses—the man who brought us from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has happened to him.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites asked Aaron to make a god for them because they were uncertain of Moses' whereabouts after he led them out of Egypt. Or HaChaim explains that "איש" denotes breeding and nobility when used with a person's name. Ramban discusses Moses' prayers to God after the sin of the golden calf, while Ibn Ezra suggests that Aaron made the golden calf as a symbol of God's glory and only a small portion of the Israelites worshipped it. The Targum adds that the Israelites believed Moses was consumed by fire on the mountain and asked for gods to lead them (Onkelos Exodus 32:23, Targum Jonathan on Exodus 32:23). 

|וָאֹמַ֤ר לָהֶם֙ לְמִ֣י זָהָ֔ב הִתְפָּרָ֖קוּ וַיִּתְּנוּ־לִ֑י וָאַשְׁלִכֵ֣הוּ בָאֵ֔שׁ וַיֵּצֵ֖א הָעֵ֥גֶל הַזֶּֽה׃|24|So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off!’ They gave it to me and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites committed sins of idolatry, fear of the nations, and immorality at Mount Sinai, the Tent of Meeting, and the Plains of Moav, affecting intellect, soul, and body with consequences lasting generations. Aaron may have lied about the golden calf's creation out of fear of Moses, possibly due to intervention or witchcraft. Betzalel healed Israel's sin with fire through crafting the Tabernacle, and Aaron reconciled with God by building an altar after the golden calf incident. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar advises caution in responses, as Aaron's explanation for the golden calf's creation caused skeptics to renounce their beliefs. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain the golden calf's creation differently, with Onkelos stating the people gave gold to Aaron, and Targum Jonathan adding that Satana entered the fire and created the calf. 

|וַיַּ֤רְא מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶת־הָעָ֔ם כִּ֥י פָרֻ֖עַ ה֑וּא כִּֽי־פְרָעֹ֣ה אַהֲרֹ֔ן לְשִׁמְצָ֖ה בְּקָמֵיהֶֽם׃|25|Moses saw that the people were out of control—since Aaron had let them get out of control—so that they were a menace  to any who might oppose them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses saw that Aaron's actions with the golden calf caused the people to be scattered and exposed to ridicule, leading to confusion and idolatry among them. The incident would remain a source of shame and disorder for generations, as certain passages should be read but not translated in public, including the sin of the golden calf. Aaron's intention in making the golden calf was to prevent a desecration of God's name by revealing Israel's sin to their enemies. The Talmud discusses the rewards for honoring Shabbat and answering amen wholeheartedly, with the incident of the Golden Calf highlighting the shame of a single person in public compared to the shame of the public in matters of the public. 

|וַיַּעֲמֹ֤ד מֹשֶׁה֙ בְּשַׁ֣עַר הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וַיֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֥י לַיהֹוָ֖ה אֵלָ֑י וַיֵּאָסְפ֥וּ אֵלָ֖יו כׇּל־בְּנֵ֥י לֵוִֽי׃|26|Moses stood up in the gate of the camp and said, “Whoever is for יהוה, come here!” And all the men of Levi rallied to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses called for those loyal to God to gather, leading the Levites to execute idol worshippers to sanctify God's name and prevent disgrace. The tribe of Levi, known for their loyalty and righteousness, was rewarded with sacred duties and praised for their zealous rejection of idolatry. The entire tribe did not worship idols, and their actions were seen as a demonstration of commitment to God. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לָהֶ֗ם כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל שִׂ֥ימוּ אִישׁ־חַרְבּ֖וֹ עַל־יְרֵכ֑וֹ עִבְר֨וּ וָשׁ֜וּבוּ מִשַּׁ֤עַר לָשַׁ֙עַר֙ בַּֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וְהִרְג֧וּ אִֽישׁ־אֶת־אָחִ֛יו וְאִ֥ישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵ֖הוּ וְאִ֥ישׁ אֶת־קְרֹבֽוֹ׃|27|He said to them, “Thus says יהוה, the God of Israel: Each of you put sword on thigh, go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay sibling, neighbor, and kin.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the different levels of faith in God, with the Levites singled out for their absolute faith during the golden calf incident and the significance of the Tabernacle in teaching about faith. The Levites were commanded to execute idol worshippers, with different forms of punishment based on involvement, and their loyalty to God rewarded with separation for service. The sons of Jacob acted in line with G-dly principles in response to Shechem, despite not aligning with ethical maxims, and the importance of being tested before authority is highlighted in Midrash. The Tribe of Levi killed idol worshippers out of righteous anger, resulting in praise from God, and Rabbi Eliezer dismisses a wise woman's question about unequal deaths in the Golden Calf incident. Nadab and Abihu die from fire in Leviticus, and God commands the Israelites to execute idol worshippers, passing through the camp to ask for forgiveness as they carry out His judgment. 

|וַיַּֽעֲשׂ֥וּ בְנֵֽי־לֵוִ֖י כִּדְבַ֣ר מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַיִּפֹּ֤ל מִן־הָעָם֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא כִּשְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת אַלְפֵ֖י אִֽישׁ׃|28|The men of Levi did as Moses had bidden; and some three thousand of the people fell that day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Moses blesses Shimon under Yehudah due to Shimon's role in the sale of Joseph, while Levi is commended for their loyalty during the golden calf incident. The Levites promptly executed idolaters, with only Levites charged with this task. In Midrash, various texts emphasize the righteousness of Levi during the golden calf incident, contrasting them with the wicked. Rabbi Hoshiya explains the deaths during the incident, with some due to Levitical action and others from a plague. In Quoting Commentary, Simeon and Levi are compared in their response to the golden calf incident, with Levi being blessed for his actions. In Second Temple, those who slew involuntarily were rewarded by living among the Levites. In Tanakh, messengers inform Jacob of Esau's approach, while in Judges, three thousand people watch Samson dance. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֗ה מִלְא֨וּ יֶדְכֶ֤ם הַיּוֹם֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה כִּ֛י אִ֥ישׁ בִּבְנ֖וֹ וּבְאָחִ֑יו וְלָתֵ֧ת עֲלֵיכֶ֛ם הַיּ֖וֹם בְּרָכָֽה׃|29|And Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves  to יהוה this day—for each of you has been against blood relations—that [God] may bestow a blessing upon you today.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructed the Levites to consecrate themselves before slaying the worshippers of the calf, demonstrating loyalty to God and receiving a blessing for their actions. The Levites were consecrated as priests in place of the first-born who failed to show loyalty to God, with Moses emphasizing loyalty as key to receiving blessings. The tribe of Levi was separated and chosen as priests, permitted to carry the ark. The text highlights the uniqueness and pre-eminence of the Jewish religion, warning against abandoning religious obligations and stressing steadfastness in faith. Philo connects the consecration of the Levites to their slaughter of idolaters, interpreting "fill your hands" as consecration, with praise and blessings bestowed upon them. Moshe instructed the people to consecrate themselves before God, offering an oblation for shedding blood and making atonement for killing their own family members to receive a blessing that day. 

|וַיְהִי֙ מִֽמׇּחֳרָ֔ת וַיֹּ֤אמֶר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־הָעָ֔ם אַתֶּ֥ם חֲטָאתֶ֖ם חֲטָאָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה וְעַתָּה֙ אֶֽעֱלֶ֣ה אֶל־יְהֹוָ֔ה אוּלַ֥י אֲכַפְּרָ֖ה בְּעַ֥ד חַטַּאתְכֶֽם׃|30|The next day Moses said to the people, “You have been guilty of a great sin. Yet I will now go up to יהוה; perhaps I may win forgiveness for your sin.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses descended the mountain, planned to return to atone for Israel's sin, emphasizing unintentional sin, repentance, and praying where the Shechinah was present. Midrash details Moses' plea for mercy after shattering the tablets and establishment of Yom Kippur for atonement. The text stresses that God rewards all creatures, reminding of human reward. Quoting commentary highlights Jacob's gifts to Esau, Moses' familiarity with God, and the importance of seeking forgiveness through prayer. Talmud specifies the format of confession for atonement, starting with "please" and including God's name. Targum states Moses will pray to Adonoy for the people's forgiveness. 

|וַיָּ֧שׇׁב מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶל־יְהֹוָ֖ה וַיֹּאמַ֑ר אָ֣נָּ֗א חָטָ֞א הָעָ֤ם הַזֶּה֙ חֲטָאָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֔ה וַיַּֽעֲשׂ֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י זָהָֽב׃|31|Moses went back to יהוה and said, “Alas, this people is guilty of a great sin in making for themselves a god of gold.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Samuel the Nagid and Rashi interpret Moses' plea for forgiveness after the sin of the Golden Calf differently, with Moses offering his own merits for atonement and not explicitly mentioning God's name due to the sin's nature. Halakhah emphasizes confession, repentance, and forsaking sin, with specific practices for expiation and atonement. The Midrash discusses the importance of the tribe of Levi not participating in the sin of the Golden Calf, the severity of lashon hara, and Moses' intercession for the Israelites. Musar highlights the significance of the merits of the fathers, the severity of lashon hara, and the importance of matching deeds with words. The Talmud emphasizes the details of confession, the equivalence of slander with deadly sins, and the impact of God's provision of gold and silver on the sin of the golden idols. Targum portrays Moses praying to Adonoy for forgiveness after the sin, while Tosefta discusses the timing and specifics of confession in the Yom Kippur service. 

|וְעַתָּ֖ה אִם־תִּשָּׂ֣א חַטָּאתָ֑ם וְאִם־אַ֕יִן מְחֵ֣נִי נָ֔א מִֽסִּפְרְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּתָֽבְתָּ׃|32|Now, if You will forgive their sin [well and good]; but if not, erase me from the record which You have written!”|

Chasidut emphasizes Moses' selflessness and willingness to sacrifice himself for the Jewish people, highlighting his humility and devotion. Commentary delves into Moses' plea to God for forgiveness, showcasing his concern for the people and association with them. Jewish Thought discusses the long lifespans in biblical times and God's provision for Moses' requests while punishing the Israelites. Kabbalah underscores Moses' love for the Jewish people, his deep connection to them, and his willingness to intercede on their behalf. Midrash praises Moses' dedication to justice, Torah, and the people, comparing his actions to other righteous figures. Mishnah outlines the measurement of the Shabbat limit and who can determine it, while Musar warns against cursing oneself.

Second Temple discusses Moses' bold questioning of God's decisions and Talmud interprets Exodus 32:32 as referring to different books and the rewards for giving oneself for the Jewish people. Tanakh states the punishment of forty years of wandering for the lack of faith, and Targum interprets Moses' offer to be blotted out of God's book if He does not forgive the Israelites' sins. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה מִ֚י אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָֽטָא־לִ֔י אֶמְחֶ֖נּוּ מִסִּפְרִֽי׃|33|But יהוה said to Moses, “Only one who has sinned against Me will I erase from My record.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moshe asked God to punish the Israelites for the sin of the golden calf for the sake of His Great Name, which is linked to theirs, showing that God's punishment is also a reflection of harm to Himself. Saadiah Gaon explains that God repented from destroying all of Israel, instead choosing to only destroy those who sinned in their minds. The Law of Moses teaches that all evils and afflictions are distributed according to justice, with strict judgment that admits no wrong. The "erev rav" caused Israel's exile and Moshe's expulsion from entering the land of Israel, but God's good intention was shown by not allowing them to be circumcised. In Midrash, the actions of Israel and Aaron caused hatred between them and God, resulting in severe judgments, but Moses prayed on their behalf. Tosafot Yom Tov explains that all deeds are written in a book to ensure nothing is forgotten. Adonoy tells Moshe that he will blot out those who have sinned against Him from His book, but Moshe's name will not be blotted out. 

|וְעַתָּ֞ה לֵ֣ךְ ׀ נְחֵ֣ה אֶת־הָעָ֗ם אֶ֤ל אֲשֶׁר־דִּבַּ֙רְתִּי֙ לָ֔ךְ הִנֵּ֥ה מַלְאָכִ֖י יֵלֵ֣ךְ לְפָנֶ֑יךָ וּבְי֣וֹם פׇּקְדִ֔י וּפָקַדְתִּ֥י עֲלֵהֶ֖ם חַטָּאתָֽם׃|34|Go now, lead the people where I told you. See, My messenger shall go before you. But when I make an accounting, I will bring them to account for their sins.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God instructs Moses to lead the people to the land of the Amorites and Canaanites, with punishment for the sin of the golden calf continuing until the End of Days. The Law of Moses teaches strict judgment in life events, with promises fulfilled based on moral conduct and the destruction of the Temple as an example. Moses pleads for forgiveness for the Israelites, emphasizing God's presence and the importance of the Tabernacle. The Zohar stresses self-reflection and the influence of the East Wind in bringing desires and healing to the world. The Talmud discusses ordained times for calamity or good, with ongoing consequences of worshipping the Golden Calf. The Tanakh highlights Moses' role in leading the people to the promised land, and the Targum interprets God's instruction to Moses with warnings about the people's sins. 

|וַיִּגֹּ֥ף יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־הָעָ֑ם עַ֚ל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשׂ֣וּ אֶת־הָעֵ֔גֶל אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה אַהֲרֹֽן׃|35|Then יהוה sent a plague upon the people, for what they did with the calf that Aaron made.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The plague in Exodus was a consequence of the people causing Aaron to make the golden calf, resulting in the deaths of thousands of young men from all twelve tribes. The Torah did not specify the number of deaths, but Moses was able to account for them by knowing the number of Jewish men of military age before the sin. The incident with the Golden Calf is highlighted as one of the ten trials that the ancestors faced, emphasizing the severity of Israel's punishment for this sin. Adonoy struck the people with a plague for worshiping the calf made by Aharon, as stated in both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Exodus 32:35.

## Exodus 33

|וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙ לֵ֣ךְ עֲלֵ֣ה מִזֶּ֔ה אַתָּ֣ה וְהָעָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶֽעֱלִ֖יתָ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֶל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִ֠שְׁבַּ֠עְתִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לְזַרְעֲךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶֽנָּה׃|1|Then יהוה said to Moses, “Set out from here, you and the people that you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring will I give it’—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains "go up" as moving north, contrasting with Abraham's journey south. Or HaChaim suggests Moses' spiritual ascent was personal. Rashi sees "go up" as a sign of God's good will. Tur HaArokh notes the people were not ready for God's presence. Chizkuni connects "go up" to moving from the sin of the golden calf. Rav Hirsch sees a shift in divine guidance. The Midrash discusses God's faithfulness, the living knowing death, and the dead knowing nothing, Moses restoring the tablets, and God conducting wars for Israel. Ramban explains the oath to Isaac and Jacob emphasizes their worthiness. Tur HaArokh adds the oath ensures Isaac blesses the nations and clarifies the land's recipient. God provided for the Israelites in highlands with abundant produce. In Targum, Adonoy instructs Moshe to lead the people to the promised land, warning of His anger and destruction. 

|וְשָׁלַחְתִּ֥י לְפָנֶ֖יךָ מַלְאָ֑ךְ וְגֵֽרַשְׁתִּ֗י אֶת־הַֽכְּנַעֲנִי֙ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י וְהַֽחִתִּי֙ וְהַפְּרִזִּ֔י הַחִוִּ֖י וְהַיְבוּסִֽי׃|2|I will send a messenger before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes using verses to overcome negative character traits, while different commentaries on Exodus 33:2:1 discuss the role of an angel in guiding the Israelites. In Jewish Thought, Akeidat Yitzchak raises questions about G-d's promises and human understanding. In Midrash, Moses is honored by the people and questions G-d's actions, while Targum translations detail the nations to be driven out by an angel. 

|אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָ֑שׁ כִּי֩ לֹ֨א אֶֽעֱלֶ֜ה בְּקִרְבְּךָ֗ כִּ֤י עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֙רֶף֙ אַ֔תָּה פֶּן־אֲכֶלְךָ֖ בַּדָּֽרֶךְ׃|3|a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go in your midst, since you are a stiffnecked people, lest I destroy you on the way.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God will not rest in the midst of Israel and may consume them if they act improperly. Moses urged loyalty to God after the incident with the calf, leading to the removal of jewelry and the need to maintain communication with the Divine. Miracles were performed to gain respect, but the Israelites did not reciprocate, likened to a prostitute. The Talmud discusses court proceedings and executions on the Sabbath, with differing opinions on permissibility. Sacrifices were not originally part of God's plan, but were a response to the Israelites' desire for closeness, as seen in the tragic story of Nadav and Avihu. The Israelites will enter a land of abundance, but God's presence will not always be with them due to their behavior. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע הָעָ֗ם אֶת־הַדָּבָ֥ר הָרָ֛ע הַזֶּ֖ה וַיִּתְאַבָּ֑לוּ וְלֹא־שָׁ֛תוּ אִ֥ישׁ עֶדְי֖וֹ עָלָֽיו׃|4|When the people heard this harsh word, they went into mourning, and none put on finery.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut interprets Genesis 31:48 as symbolizing the transition from miracles to Torah longing, with the naming of the stones hinting at spiritual growth towards Torah study. Commentary explains the removal of ornaments as mourning for the potential loss of God's presence, representing unworthiness. Jewish Thought explores Moses' concern for the Israelites' well-being despite God's decision, likening it to a doctor advising against harmful foods. Midrash discusses the Israelites' repeated failures despite divine guidance, leading to consequences like not entering the promised land. Musar teaches that mourning for sins can lead to God's pity, while Quoting Commentary suggests the removal of jewelry after the sin of the golden calf. Tanakh instructs Aaron and his sons not to mourn in a way that may anger the community, while Targum describes the people mourning and not wearing crowns in Exodus 33:4. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה אֱמֹ֤ר אֶל־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אַתֶּ֣ם עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֔רֶף רֶ֧גַע אֶחָ֛ד אֶֽעֱלֶ֥ה בְקִרְבְּךָ֖ וְכִלִּיתִ֑יךָ וְעַתָּ֗ה הוֹרֵ֤ד עֶדְיְךָ֙ מֵֽעָלֶ֔יךָ וְאֵדְעָ֖ה מָ֥ה אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־לָּֽךְ׃|5|יהוה said to Moses, “Say to the Israelite people, ‘You are a stiffnecked people. If I were to go in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you. Now, then, leave off your finery, and I will consider what to do to you.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: Genesis 31:48 alludes to the 33rd day of the Omer counting, symbolizing the Jewish people's transition to longing for the Torah and whole-hearted service to God. Commentary: Removal of jewelry signifies loss of spiritual distinction and need for repentance. Jewish Thought: Kuzari discusses Hebrew language, religious axioms, and importance of accents. Kabbalah: Zohar explains protection of Israelites from evil serpent. Midrash: Emphasizes Israel's connection to God, consequences of sins, and divine protection. Musar: Humility in repentance involves gentle conduct and avoidance of luxury. Quoting Commentary: Blood symbolizes covenant with God, breach after golden calf incident. Targum: Adonoy warns Israelites of destruction due to stiff-neckedness and instructs removal of ornaments. 

|וַיִּֽתְנַצְּל֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֶת־עֶדְיָ֖ם מֵהַ֥ר חוֹרֵֽב׃|6|So the Israelites remained stripped of their finery from Mount Horeb on.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the Children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments as a symbol of accepting God's Kingship with a full heart and soul. The Halakhah teaches that Leviathan is a kosher fish and describes a future resurrection where the righteous will enjoy rewards with their bodies and souls. In Jewish Thought, Israel received crowns from angels at Mount Sinai, which were later removed after the sin with the golden calf. The Midrash recounts Abraham defending Israel against accusations of violating the mitzvot. Musar discusses the gifts from Gentile nations and Israel's loss of jewelry after the golden calf incident. The Talmud explains how the Jewish people were rewarded with crowns for prioritizing action over listening to God, which were later taken away after the sin with the golden calf. 

|וּמֹשֶׁה֩ יִקַּ֨ח אֶת־הָאֹ֜הֶל וְנָֽטָה־ל֣וֹ ׀ מִח֣וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֗ה הַרְחֵק֙ מִן־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וְקָ֥רָא ל֖וֹ אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד וְהָיָה֙ כׇּל־מְבַקֵּ֣שׁ יְהֹוָ֔ה יֵצֵא֙ אֶל־אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֔ד אֲשֶׁ֖ר מִח֥וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|7|Now Moses would take the Tent and pitch it outside the camp, at some distance from the camp. It was called the Tent of Meeting, and whoever sought יהוה would go out to the Tent of Meeting that was outside the camp.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree on the number of Chanukah lights, with the latter's practice of starting with one light and increasing being accepted. Halakhah permits a student to answer halachic questions from a distance of twelve mil, but cannot establish themselves as an authority without permission. In Kabbalah, the Meeting Tent is where HaShem dwells and communicates with the people, particularly Moses. The Midrash highlights Moses's actions of pitching his tent outside the camp as a symbol of humility and reconciliation. In Musar, Baal Haturim suggests leaving home to study Torah, and Moses moves his tent to dispel suspicions of adultery. The Second Temple commentary emphasizes Moses seeking God outside the camp, symbolizing the journey to divine peace. In the Talmud, Rabbi Simai discusses the crowning of Israel with angels, and the importance of respecting teachers is emphasized. Lastly, in Targum, the Tent of Meeting outside the camp is a place for seeking instruction and forgiveness from Adonoy. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה כְּצֵ֤את מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־הָאֹ֔הֶל יָק֙וּמוּ֙ כׇּל־הָעָ֔ם וְנִ֨צְּב֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ פֶּ֣תַח אׇהֳל֑וֹ וְהִבִּ֙יטוּ֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י מֹשֶׁ֔ה עַד־בֹּא֖וֹ הָאֹֽהֱלָה׃|8|Whenever Moses went out to the Tent, all the people would rise and stand, at the entrance of each tent, and gaze after Moses until he had entered the Tent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses overcame suspicions of theft and adultery through good character traits, symbolized by his actions entering the Tent of Meeting. Standing in deference to sages like Moses, the av beit din, and the nasi is required, with specific guidelines for when to stand and sit. The Hebrew word "hibbit" signifies viewing with the eye and contemplating intellectually, seen in examples like the Israelites observing Moses and Abraham contemplating the heavens. In various Midrashim, Moses is honored by the people, makes an accounting of expenses, and mollifies rumors. Different interpretations of standing before Torah scholars are discussed in the Talmud, with one view praising the act and the other criticizing it. The Targum describes how people would watch Moses with envy as he entered the tabernacle. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה כְּבֹ֤א מֹשֶׁה֙ הָאֹ֔הֱלָה יֵרֵד֙ עַמּ֣וּד הֶֽעָנָ֔ן וְעָמַ֖ד פֶּ֣תַח הָאֹ֑הֶל וְדִבֶּ֖ר עִם־מֹשֶֽׁה׃|9|And when Moses entered the Tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the Tent, while [God] spoke with Moses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses had a close relationship with God, evidenced by the pillar of cloud in the tent and the ongoing conversation marked by respect. The Jewish people honored Moses for his closeness to God, while cynics criticized him for benefiting from the Tabernacle's construction. Onkelos focused on God revealing Himself in his translations, while the Talmud discusses the respect due to elders and the High Priest. In Exodus 33:9, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the Pillar of Cloud descending at the entrance of the tent when Moses entered, with the Word of the Lord speaking to him. 

|וְרָאָ֤ה כׇל־הָעָם֙ אֶת־עַמּ֣וּד הֶֽעָנָ֔ן עֹמֵ֖ד פֶּ֣תַח הָאֹ֑הֶל וְקָ֤ם כׇּל־הָעָם֙ וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲו֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ פֶּ֥תַח אׇהֳלֽוֹ׃|10|When all the people saw the pillar of cloud poised at the entrance of the Tent, all the people would rise and bow low, at the entrance of each tent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The people prostrated themselves in front of the pillar of cloud at the entrance of Moses' tent as a sign of respect for the attribute of כבוד present in the tent, not for the pillar itself. Moses would be honored by the people standing at their tent's entrance when he went to the tent, and the pillar of cloud signified the Divine Presence. The Torah emphasizes the unique experience of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, with God's presence appearing above the kapporet and not within the cloud, using the cloud of incense to shield the High Priest from seeing God's glory directly. (Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 16:2:2) 

|וְדִבֶּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל־פָּנִ֔ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְשָׁב֙ אֶל־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וּמְשָׁ֨רְת֜וֹ יְהוֹשֻׁ֤עַ בִּן־נוּן֙ נַ֔עַר לֹ֥א יָמִ֖ישׁ מִתּ֥וֹךְ הָאֹֽהֶל׃|11|יהוה would speak to Moses face to face, as one person speaks to another. And he would then return to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, [serving as] deputy,  would not stir out of the Tent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the impact of intense light on the wicked, the transition to the oral tradition after Moses' death, and the Torah's eternal nature. Commentary from various sources delves into the age and role of Joshua, while Halakhah highlights Moses' unique prophetic abilities. Jewish Thought emphasizes learning from outstanding individuals, losing one's first wife as a symbol of judgment loss, and submission to wise teachers. Midrash texts discuss Moses' relationship with God and Joshua's role, while Musar explores Moses' exceptional prophetic clarity. Quoting Commentary emphasizes Moses' unique relationship with God. Second Temple texts discuss agricultural ordinances and Moses as the friend of God, Talmud presents debates on Joshua's role, Tanakh mentions Joshua as Moses' successor, Targum describes Moses and Joshua's interactions, and Tosefta discusses Moses and Ezra's roles in teaching Torah. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶל־יְהֹוָ֗ה רְ֠אֵ֠ה אַתָּ֞ה אֹמֵ֤ר אֵלַי֙ הַ֚עַל אֶת־הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה וְאַתָּה֙ לֹ֣א הֽוֹדַעְתַּ֔נִי אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־תִּשְׁלַ֖ח עִמִּ֑י וְאַתָּ֤ה אָמַ֙רְתָּ֙ יְדַעְתִּ֣יךָֽ בְשֵׁ֔ם וְגַם־מָצָ֥אתָ חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינָֽי׃|12|Moses said to יהוה, “See, You say to me, ‘Lead this people forward,’ but You have not made known to me whom You will send with me. Further, You have said, ‘I have singled you out by name, and you have, indeed, gained My favor.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut texts emphasize the spiritual benefits of Sabbath observance through preparation and faith in God, with different aspects representing masculine and feminine elements. Halakhah details the Torah readings and practices during the Sabbath of Chol Hamo'ed, while Mishnah outlines readings for specific holidays. Commentary explores Moses' relationship with God, questioning the presence of an angel, and Midrash delves into Moses' interactions with God and the people. Musar discusses Moses' plea for God's presence, and Talmud outlines Torah portions and haftarot for Shabbat during Passover and Sukkot. Targum depicts Moses seeking reassurance from God about his journey to Canaan. 

|וְעַתָּ֡ה אִם־נָא֩ מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּעֵינֶ֗יךָ הוֹדִעֵ֤נִי נָא֙ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֔ךָ וְאֵדָ֣עֲךָ֔ לְמַ֥עַן אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֶ֑יךָ וּרְאֵ֕ה כִּ֥י עַמְּךָ֖ הַגּ֥וֹי הַזֶּֽה׃|13|Now, if I have truly gained Your favor, pray let me know Your ways, that I may know You and continue in Your favor. Consider, too, that this nation is Your people.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of knowing and being conscious of God in all actions to have one's path straightened, as reflected in various verses from Tehillim and other texts. Moses asks God to inform him of His ways and attributes to deepen his relationship with God and lead the Israelites effectively. The blessing of al netilat yada’im and other fixed blessings emphasize God's revealed and hidden aspects. Moses, Maimonides, and other sages seek knowledge of God's ways and attributes, with the Torah emphasizing the importance of serving the Creator. The righteous may suffer while the wicked prosper due to the concept of transmigration of souls. Moses pleads for God's mercy and compassion towards the Israelites, showing the power of prayer and advocacy. The Talmud explains that the prosperity or suffering of individuals is based on their righteousness or wickedness and the actions of their ancestors. The author acknowledges the unpredictability of events on earth and the incomprehensible ways of God. 

|וַיֹּאמַ֑ר פָּנַ֥י יֵלֵ֖כוּ וַהֲנִחֹ֥תִי לָֽךְ׃|14|And [God] said, “I will go in the lead and will  lighten your burden.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the Tsaddik reflects God's attributes towards Israel, with forgiveness related to "panim" and rectifying the feet leading to forgiveness. In Exodus 33:14, God's presence is linked to His anger, essence, or light resting on Moses, preceding the people on their journeys and connected to Justice. The Rabbi uses a sun simile to explain God's attributes, contrasting 'Elōhim' and 'Adonāi,' and emphasizing 'panim' in relation to God's anger. In Midrash, Moses questions God about His presence, asks to understand His ways, and prays powerfully, with the role of angels in protecting Israel discussed. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar advises against certain actions in dealing with others in Pirkei Avot 4:18. Rabbeinu Bahya suggests that Avram's sacrifices were accepted by male and female elements, while Moses and Pinchas work to turn back God's anger. In the Talmud, it is advised not to placate someone while they are angry. God chose the heirs of the ancestors in Tanakh, and in Targum, God's presence is connected to granting rest after His displeasure passes. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֵלָ֑יו אִם־אֵ֤ין פָּנֶ֙יךָ֙ הֹלְכִ֔ים אַֽל־תַּעֲלֵ֖נוּ מִזֶּֽה׃|15|And he replied, “Unless You go in the lead, do not make us leave this place.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that sin should not reach the depth of the heart to maintain a connection with God, contrasting the sin of the golden calf with the mitzvot. Jewish Thought discusses the significance of idol worship, priests' blessings, and the completion of the tabernacle in restoring the relationship between man and God. Midrash emphasizes God's presence protecting Israel and Moses' insistence on God's presence over an angel. Musar highlights Moses' desire to see the holiest part of the Land of Israel and God's denial due to the people's unworthiness. Quoting Commentary discusses Ramban, Onkelos, and Rashi's interpretations of Jacob's sacrifices, Moses' plea for God's presence, and metaphysical inquiries. Second Temple emphasizes the importance of divine guidance and the dangers of moving without it. Talmud and Targum both discuss Moses' refusal to travel without God's presence and the importance of being under God's favor before leaving. 

|וּבַמֶּ֣ה ׀ יִוָּדַ֣ע אֵפ֗וֹא כִּֽי־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּעֵינֶ֙יךָ֙ אֲנִ֣י וְעַמֶּ֔ךָ הֲל֖וֹא בְּלֶכְתְּךָ֣ עִמָּ֑נוּ וְנִפְלִ֙ינוּ֙ אֲנִ֣י וְעַמְּךָ֔ מִכׇּ֨ל־הָעָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה׃|16|For how shall it be known that Your people have gained Your favor unless You go with us, so that we may be distinguished, Your people and I, from every people on the face of the earth?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how Dawidh's vitality was renewed constantly, symbolized by tefillin, connecting to the concept of Mashiach and everlasting life. In Jewish Thought, the attributes of God are known through His way, with Moses seeking a unique relationship with God for the Israelites. Kabbalah explains how the Jewish people appeal to HaShem for mercy and forgiveness, while Midrash highlights Moses' requests and rewards from God. The Talmud states that Moses wrote the Torah, Balaam's portion, and Job's book, showing Job was Jewish, and Targum emphasizes the importance of God's presence in distinguishing the Israelites from other nations. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה גַּ֣ם אֶת־הַדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּ֛ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתָּ אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֑ה כִּֽי־מָצָ֤אתָ חֵן֙ בְּעֵינַ֔י וָאֵדָעֲךָ֖ בְּשֵֽׁם׃|17|And יהוה said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have asked; for you have truly gained My favor and I have singled you out by name.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God's favor towards Moses and Binyamin is based on their attributes and actions, leading to divine revelations and miracles. Moses' relationship with God is highlighted through his understanding of God's essence and the thirteen attributes, culminating in a covenant with the Jewish people. The Midrash contrasts Moses and Pinhas's virtues and the unpredictability of life's circumstances. In the Second Temple text, Noah and Moses are praised for their pleasing qualities towards God, with Moses being depicted as having a unique relationship with Him. Targum emphasizes God's fulfillment of Moses' requests due to his favor and good name. 

|וַיֹּאמַ֑ר הַרְאֵ֥נִי נָ֖א אֶת־כְּבֹדֶֽךָ׃|18|He said, “Oh, let me behold Your Presence!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses asked to see God's glory, but was told it was beyond human potential, with God shielding him to prevent harm from the intense light. Despite seeking a closer connection to God, a direct visual encounter with His essence was not possible for mortals. The text emphasizes the challenges of fully comprehending God's essence and the importance of humility and piety when seeking to understand and connect with God. Moses' desire to see God's glory is highlighted, with discussions on the limitations of human comprehension and the need for individuals to strive for moral and intellectual virtues to approach closer to God. Moses also hid his face out of respect and fear when God revealed Himself to him, with the importance of humility when seeking to understand and connect with God emphasized in the Midrash. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אֲנִ֨י אַעֲבִ֤יר כׇּל־טוּבִי֙ עַל־פָּנֶ֔יךָ וְקָרָ֧אתִֽי בְשֵׁ֛ם יְהֹוָ֖ה לְפָנֶ֑יךָ וְחַנֹּתִי֙ אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָחֹ֔ן וְרִחַמְתִּ֖י אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲרַחֵֽם׃|19|And [God] answered, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim before you the name יהוה, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show,”  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of individual effort in understanding one's rank and level determined by God, with Reb Noson highlighting the need to find one's good points to awaken spiritually. In Halakhah, the Amidah prayer describes God's eternal love, kingship, and wisdom towards mankind. Jewish Thought explores the unity and individuality of God's providence, while Kabbalah delves into the mysteries of God's will and mercy. Liturgy focuses on trust in God's mercy and fervent prayer, while Midrash discusses the importance of sincere prayer and the relationship between God and the Jewish people. Musar highlights God's mercy to all, even the undeserving, and the reliance on God's grace in prayer. Commentary from various sources discusses God's grace, mercy, and providence, with Talmud and Targum exploring Moses' requests and God's promises of compassion and mercy. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לֹ֥א תוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־פָּנָ֑י כִּ֛י לֹֽא־יִרְאַ֥נִי הָאָדָ֖ם וָחָֽי׃|20|continuing, “But you cannot see My face, for a human being may not see Me and live.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut texts discuss the difference between seeing and understanding, with prophets like Moses able to see and understand on a deeper level, while others, like Isaiah, can only see. The concept that seeing God's essence would result in death is explored, supported by biblical figures who feared death upon seeing angels or God's messenger. Hashem's Thirteen Attributes of Mercy were revealed to Moshe Rabbeinu after forgiving Israel, emphasizing His merciful nature. The Torah teaches that it is impossible for a living man to see God, with even the High Priest Aaron only entering the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement. Moses requested to see God's ways and glory, but God replied that no one can see His face and live, reflecting the paradox of His presence threatening the existence of anything apart from Him. The incident of Reuben is read but not translated out of respect in the Talmud, while the story of Tamar is both read and translated. In Deuteronomy 5:21, the Israelites acknowledge seeing God's majestic Presence and hearing His voice from the fire, realizing they can live when addressed by God. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֔ה הִנֵּ֥ה מָק֖וֹם אִתִּ֑י וְנִצַּבְתָּ֖ עַל־הַצּֽוּר׃|21|And יהוה said, “See, there is a place near Me. Station yourself on the rock|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the concept of God being the "place" of the world, emphasizing that the heart filled with Godliness becomes His dwelling place, while the world is not His place. Various commentaries, including Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and others, provide interpretations of Exodus 33, highlighting God's transcendence and the importance of recognizing Him as the source of all things. Midrashic texts and Talmudic discussions further explore the idea that God is the Place of the world but not limited by physical space, with references to rewards for the righteous, God's presence, and the World to Come. The Targum also mentions a place prepared before God and instructs Moses to stand on the rock. 

|וְהָיָה֙ בַּעֲבֹ֣ר כְּבֹדִ֔י וְשַׂמְתִּ֖יךָ בְּנִקְרַ֣ת הַצּ֑וּר וְשַׂכֹּתִ֥י כַפִּ֛י עָלֶ֖יךָ עַד־עׇבְרִֽי׃|22|and, as My Presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and shield you with My hand until I have passed by.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the protection and shielding provided by God to Moses and David when they encountered His glory, as seen in Exodus 33:20 and 33:22. Various commentaries explain the literal translation of "kappi" as "My hand," the role of a protective cloud, and the rays of light Moses experienced. The pleasure experienced by Adam in the Garden of Eden before sin is contrasted with the limitations and death that followed sin, with a promise of returning joy in body and soul for the resurrected. The relationship between the individual and the community, exemplified by Pinchas, is highlighted in Jewish Thought, emphasizing restoration and unity. Liturgy expresses a prayerful approach to God, seeking understanding, strength, and forgiveness. The Midrash explains Moses' closeness to God and the rays of glory he received, along with the role of the cloud in indicating permission for Moses to enter God's presence. Rabbi Yoḥanan discusses the intensity of light experienced by Moses and Elijah, with miraculous phenomena and the preservation of Moses' soul under the Throne of Glory. The Targum emphasizes God's protection of Moses by placing him in a cleft or cavern of the rock and overshadowing him with His Word or hand as His glory passes by in Exodus 33:22. 

|וַהֲסִרֹתִי֙ אֶת־כַּפִּ֔י וְרָאִ֖יתָ אֶת־אֲחֹרָ֑י וּפָנַ֖י לֹ֥א יֵרָאֽוּ׃|23|Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text delves into the concept of seeing God's back but not His face, with interpretations from various commentators such as Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Rashbam, Steinsaltz, and Da'at Zekenim. It discusses Moses' desire to comprehend the truth of God's existence, the significance of the knot on tefillin straps in Halakhah, the divine knowledge received by Moses in Jewish Thought, the representation of Binah in Kabbalah, and Moses' interactions with God in Midrash. Additionally, Second Temple texts emphasize the impossibility of seeing God's essence, while Talmudic teachings focus on the symbolism of phylacteries and facing the King of all kings in the World to Come. Tanakh references God speaking directly to Moses, and Targum translations of Exodus 33:23.

## Exodus 34

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה פְּסׇל־לְךָ֛ שְׁנֵֽי־לֻחֹ֥ת אֲבָנִ֖ים כָּרִאשֹׁנִ֑ים וְכָתַבְתִּי֙ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֔ת אֶ֨ת־הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָי֛וּ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֥ת הָרִאשֹׁנִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ׃|1|יהוה said to Moses: “Carve two tablets of stone like the first, and I will inscribe upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you shattered.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut texts emphasize the concept of "P'SoL" in Torah teachings, connecting challenges to achievements like Yosef's success after his brothers broke the luchot. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, Malbim, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, Tze'enah Ure'enah, Abarbanel, Chizkuni, and Halakhah sources discuss the significance of carving the tablets, Torah readings during festivals and fast days, and the qualities a prophet must possess. Kabbalah highlights the broken tablets and oral Torah, while Midrash explores Moses pleading for forgiveness for the Israelites. Mishnah details Torah readings for specific holidays, and Talmud discusses Moses breaking the tablets, becoming wealthy from them, and generously giving the Torah to the Jewish people. Targum describes Adonoy instructing Moshe to carve new tablets with the same words as the first. 

|וֶהְיֵ֥ה נָכ֖וֹן לַבֹּ֑קֶר וְעָלִ֤יתָ בַבֹּ֙קֶר֙ אֶל־הַ֣ר סִינַ֔י וְנִצַּבְתָּ֥ לִ֛י שָׁ֖ם עַל־רֹ֥אשׁ הָהָֽר׃|2|Be ready by morning, and in the morning come up to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to Me, on the top of the mountain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses ascended Mount Sinai three times for forty days each after the revelation, with a total of 120 days between the revelation and bringing down the second set of tablets. Sefer HaChinukh 32:1 discusses the prohibition of doing work on Shabbat, Ramban emphasizes the lack of liability when the individual does not physically perform the work themselves. The Midrash discusses the cruelty of the generation of the Flood, the tranquility granted to them by God, the rapid childbirth experienced by the women of that generation, and the destruction and repopulation of the world through Noah and his descendants. Ramban explains that the plural "they" in the command to make the ark in Exodus 25:10 is meant to involve all of Israel in the holiest dwelling-place of the Most High. In Exodus 34:2, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both emphasize the importance of being prepared in the morning to ascend Mount Sinai and stand before God on the mountain's summit. 

|וְאִישׁ֙ לֹֽא־יַעֲלֶ֣ה עִמָּ֔ךְ וְגַם־אִ֥ישׁ אַל־יֵרָ֖א בְּכׇל־הָהָ֑ר גַּם־הַצֹּ֤אן וְהַבָּקָר֙ אַל־יִרְע֔וּ אֶל־מ֖וּל הָהָ֥ר הַהֽוּא׃|3|No one else shall come up with you, and no one else shall be seen anywhere on the mountain; neither shall the flocks and the herds graze at the foot of this mountain.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses ascended Mount Sinai alone to receive the second set of tablets, given quietly to avoid the evil eye. The commandment to not remove the poles of the ark is considered practiced throughout generations, unlike temporary commandments. G'd provides safeguards against the pitfalls of nature, with brain and good character overcoming difficulties. The symbolism of the two tablets is discussed in relation to various aspects in different commentaries. Moshe pleads for intimacy with God, leading to a more successful second delivery of the Tablets. Sanctity is not inherent to a place but due to the Divine Presence, and conjugal rights were emphasized in the instruction to "return to your tents." In Exodus 34:3, it is emphasized that no man, sheep, or cattle should be seen on the mountain where Moses is going. 

|וַיִּפְסֹ֡ל שְׁנֵֽי־לֻחֹ֨ת אֲבָנִ֜ים כָּרִאשֹׁנִ֗ים וַיַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם מֹשֶׁ֤ה בַבֹּ֙קֶר֙ וַיַּ֙עַל֙ אֶל־הַ֣ר סִינַ֔י כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה אֹת֑וֹ וַיִּקַּ֣ח בְּיָד֔וֹ שְׁנֵ֖י לֻחֹ֥ת אֲבָנִֽים׃|4|So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the first, and early in the morning he went up on Mount Sinai, as יהוה had commanded him, taking the two stone tablets with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the repetition of "two tables of stone" in Exodus 34:4 as a Hebrew style, while Steinsaltz describes how Moses carved new tablets and Chizkuni notes his early rise on the 29th of Av. Moses did not turn to his affairs after descending from the mountain, as stated in Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael, and the Torah was given on the Sabbath, according to Ein Yaakov. Rashi notes Moses' early ascents, Rabbeinu Bahya discusses the symbolism of the Tablets, and Ramban explains the use of hyssop in the Torah. The Gemara explains Moses' early ascents and his instructions for separation in the morning, while in Deuteronomy 10, Moses made new tablets and ascended the mountain. 

|וַיֵּ֤רֶד יְהֹוָה֙ בֶּֽעָנָ֔ן וַיִּתְיַצֵּ֥ב עִמּ֖וֹ שָׁ֑ם וַיִּקְרָ֥א בְשֵׁ֖ם יְהֹוָֽה׃|5|יהוה came down in a cloud—and stood with him there, proclaiming the name יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how God minimizes the impact of sins through retribution and rewards for good deeds. Commentary on Exodus 34:5 focuses on the Lord's presence with Moses in the cloud, emphasizing celestial angels and teaching Moses to proclaim His name. Halakhah explains how Sukkah and Lulav complement each other in reminding of the Shekhina's presence and revealing holiness. Jewish Thought analyzes the order of verses in Akeidat Yitzchak 105:1:9, highlighting Moses' death and mourning. Liturgy emphasizes God's forgiveness and kindness in the recitation of the thirteen attributes. Midrash discusses Moses' unique relationship with the Lord and the building of the Tabernacle on the Day of Atonement. Quoting Commentary explains the phrase "פנים אל פנים" denoting anger and the challenge of the relationship between humans and God. Targum elaborates on the Lord's revelation in a cloud with Moses invoking His name in Exodus 34:5. 

|וַיַּעֲבֹ֨ר יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ עַל־פָּנָיו֮ וַיִּקְרָא֒ יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ יְהֹוָ֔ה אֵ֥ל רַח֖וּם וְחַנּ֑וּן אֶ֥רֶךְ אַפַּ֖יִם וְרַב־חֶ֥סֶד וֶאֱמֶֽת׃|6|יהוה passed before him and proclaimed: “!יהוה! יהוה  a God compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various texts discuss the attributes of God, such as mercy and compassion, emphasizing their importance in daily life and spiritual growth. The significance of understanding and embodying these attributes, as well as the interplay between mercy and judgment, repentance, and forgiveness, is explored through references to Torah verses and teachings from respected commentators. The Mishnah discusses the formula of an oath of testimony, while Musar emphasizes the cultivation of mercy and control of anger as praiseworthy qualities. The Gemara and Tanakh highlight God's compassionate and forgiving nature, encouraging repentance and seeking His mercy. The Targum translations of Exodus 34:6 emphasize God's merciful and gracious attributes. 

|נֹצֵ֥ר חֶ֙סֶד֙ לָאֲלָפִ֔ים נֹשֵׂ֥א עָוֺ֛ן וָפֶ֖שַׁע וְחַטָּאָ֑ה וְנַקֵּה֙ לֹ֣א יְנַקֶּ֔ה פֹּקֵ֣ד ׀ עֲוֺ֣ן אָב֗וֹת עַל־בָּנִים֙ וְעַל־בְּנֵ֣י בָנִ֔ים עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁ֖ים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִֽים׃|7|extending kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin—yet not remitting all punishment, but visiting the iniquity of parents upon children and children’s children, upon the third and fourth generations.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

|וַיְמַהֵ֖ר מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַיִּקֹּ֥ד אַ֖רְצָה וַיִּשְׁתָּֽחוּ׃|8|Moses hastened to bow low to the ground in homage,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moshe quickly bowed in worship after receiving the thirteen attributes of mercy, recognizing the importance of God's patience in erasing sin and ensuring eternal life for Israel. This patience is linked to the Land of Israel and the aspect of "slow to anger," emphasizing the need to cling to God's attributes, especially Erekh Apayim, in order to overcome obstacles and trials in serving God. Moses' act of prostration was a way of expressing thankfulness and seizing the auspicious moment to make requests of God, similar to Abraham's quick movement to greet visitors at his tent. 

|וַיֹּ֡אמֶר אִם־נָא֩ מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּעֵינֶ֙יךָ֙ אֲדֹנָ֔י יֵֽלֶךְ־נָ֥א אֲדֹנָ֖י בְּקִרְבֵּ֑נוּ כִּ֤י עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֙רֶף֙ ה֔וּא וְסָלַחְתָּ֛ לַעֲוֺנֵ֥נוּ וּלְחַטָּאתֵ֖נוּ וּנְחַלְתָּֽנוּ׃|9|and said, “If I have gained Your favor, O my lord, pray, let my lord go in our midst, even though this is a stiffnecked people. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes serving God with a simple will beyond reason, as shown by Moses' invocation of "measure for measure." The Rabbi in Jewish Thought uses a simile of sunlight to explain God's attributes, while Kabbalah discusses seeking mercy from the Lord-Adona”y-אדנ״י. Liturgy texts stress repentance and forgiveness, citing God's mercy and kindness. Midrash highlights Moses' pleas for mercy and his rebukes of Israel, contrasting with Joshua's acceptance of an angel. Orchot Tzadikim describes Israel as stubborn and stiff-necked, while Tanakh and Targum show Moses asking for God's forgiveness and favor for the Israelites. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הִנֵּ֣ה אָנֹכִי֮ כֹּרֵ֣ת בְּרִית֒ נֶ֤גֶד כׇּֽל־עַמְּךָ֙ אֶעֱשֶׂ֣ה נִפְלָאֹ֔ת אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־נִבְרְא֥וּ בְכׇל־הָאָ֖רֶץ וּבְכׇל־הַגּוֹיִ֑ם וְרָאָ֣ה כׇל־הָ֠עָ֠ם אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֨ה בְקִרְבּ֜וֹ אֶת־מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ כִּֽי־נוֹרָ֣א ה֔וּא אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲנִ֖י עֹשֶׂ֥ה עִמָּֽךְ׃|10|[God] said: I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will work such wonders as have not been wrought on all the earth or in any nation; and all the people who are with you  shall see how awesome are יהוה’s deeds which I will perform for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses human completeness through Yaakov's fear of God rooted in Torah, emphasizing the importance of balanced attributes and faith to prevent deficiency. Halakhah details mourning customs on 9 Av, while Jewish Thought highlights the importance of miracles and mitzvot in Jewish history. Kabbalah discusses the use of holy names for miracles, and Midrash focuses on Moses' supplication and the future gathering of exiles. Musar interprets Elohim as Moses, emphasizing the Jewish people's role as God's army. Commentary emphasizes the unique covenant between God, Moses, and the Israelites, while the Talmud mentions a covenant made with the thirteen attributes for answered prayers. Targum adds promises of wondrous deeds and the return of the righteous from exile. 

|שְׁמׇ֨ר־לְךָ֔ אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י מְצַוְּךָ֣ הַיּ֑וֹם הִנְנִ֧י גֹרֵ֣שׁ מִפָּנֶ֗יךָ אֶת־הָאֱמֹרִי֙ וְהַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י וְהַחִתִּי֙ וְהַפְּרִזִּ֔י וְהַחִוִּ֖י וְהַיְבוּסִֽי׃|11|Mark well what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes that all compassion comes from God and stresses the importance of giving to those in need, even if they are not scholars. Giving even a small gift to a poor man is required to fulfill the commandment of not appearing before God empty-handed. In Exodus 34, God instructs Moses to transmit commandments to the Israelites, warning against idolatry and intermingling with other nations, emphasizing the three festivals, and reminding them to keep a distance from idolatry. The commentary includes explanations from Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Ramban on various aspects of the text. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos mention the tribes God is driving out from before the Israelites in Exodus 34:11. 

|הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֗ פֶּן־תִּכְרֹ֤ת בְּרִית֙ לְיוֹשֵׁ֣ב הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתָּ֖ה בָּ֣א עָלֶ֑יהָ פֶּן־יִהְיֶ֥ה לְמוֹקֵ֖שׁ בְּקִרְבֶּֽךָ׃|12|Beware of making a covenant with the inhabitants of the land against which you are advancing, lest they be a snare in your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Steinsaltz warn against forming alliances with the inhabitants of Canaan in Exodus 34:12 to avoid moral corruption. Sefer HaChinukh prohibits eating gifts to idol worship, Mishneh Torah specifies Sabbath readings during Chol Hamo'ed, and Rabbi Ishmael considers Israelites outside Israel as idol worshipers if they attend feasts by idol worshipers. Machzor Vitry instructs on rituals for Shavuot, emphasizing the connection between Ruth's conversion and receiving the Torah, as well as the importance of charity for the living on festival days. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Exodus 34:12 stress the danger of making covenants with the people in the land. 

|כִּ֤י אֶת־מִזְבְּחֹתָם֙ תִּתֹּצ֔וּן וְאֶת־מַצֵּבֹתָ֖ם תְּשַׁבֵּר֑וּן וְאֶת־אֲשֵׁרָ֖יו תִּכְרֹתֽוּן׃|13|No, you must tear down their altars, smash their pillars, and cut down their sacred posts;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rashi explain the command to break down altars in Exodus 34:13 as similar to utterly overthrowing them, clarifying that an אשרה was a tree worshipped by idolaters. Steinsaltz emphasizes the need to completely destroy all objects of idol worship, including altars, monuments, and sacred trees used in idolatrous rites. Halakhah dictates that removing a stone from the altar with destructive intent results in lashes, and various actions related to idol worship are forbidden, such as using stones or water from worshipped sources. The Sabeans believed in the eternity of the Universe and viewed the heavens as God, while the Midrash emphasizes the prohibition against creating idols in various forms. Ramban explains the difference between pillars and altars in idolatrous practices, and Targum interprets Exodus 34:13 as a command to destroy all objects associated with pagan worship. 

|כִּ֛י לֹ֥א תִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה לְאֵ֣ל אַחֵ֑ר כִּ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ קַנָּ֣א שְׁמ֔וֹ אֵ֥ל קַנָּ֖א הֽוּא׃|14|for you must not worship any other god, because יהוה, whose name is Impassioned, is an impassioned God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that separating from a tzaddik is like idolatry. Halakhah explains the prohibition against worshiping false gods and the liability for performing deeds of worship. Kabbalah warns against defiling the holy covenant and bowing to other gods. Midrash emphasizes not worshiping idolatry and the consequences of changing the Torah. Mishnah discusses liability for judges issuing erroneous rulings. Musar contrasts deceitful Bileam with zealous Pinchas and sanctified Benjamin. Quoting Commentary clarifies not accepting other deities and details rulings on idol worship. Talmud explores nuances of idol worship actions and forbidden actions. Targum emphasizes the prohibition against worshiping other gods. 

|פֶּן־תִּכְרֹ֥ת בְּרִ֖ית לְיוֹשֵׁ֣ב הָאָ֑רֶץ וְזָנ֣וּ ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵיהֶ֗ם וְזָבְחוּ֙ לֵאלֹ֣הֵיהֶ֔ם וְקָרָ֣א לְךָ֔ וְאָכַלְתָּ֖ מִזִּבְחֽוֹ׃|15|You must not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for they will lust after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and invite you, and you will eat of their sacrifices.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text warns against making covenants with the inhabitants of Canaan and participating in their idolatrous practices, as it can lead to intermarriage and idol worship. Rambam's Mishneh Torah emphasizes the severity of the prohibition against idolatry, even ruling that a gentile's slaughter is considered nevelah unless they do not engage in idolatry. The Talmud advises against pretending to understand something one does not and warns against engaging in idol worship, even unknowingly. The Targum translations of Exodus 34:15 also caution against making covenants with the people in the land, as it may lead to idol worship. Additionally, living in Eretz Yisrael is considered equal to all the mitzvot in the Torah, and leaving during times of peace is likened to idol worship. 

|וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ מִבְּנֹתָ֖יו לְבָנֶ֑יךָ וְזָנ֣וּ בְנֹתָ֗יו אַחֲרֵי֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵיהֶ֔ן וְהִזְנוּ֙ אֶת־בָּנֶ֔יךָ אַחֲרֵ֖י אֱלֹהֵיהֶֽן׃|16|And when you take [wives into your households] from among their daughters for your sons, their daughters will lust after their gods and will cause your sons to lust after their gods.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Intermarrying with idolaters is forbidden for Jews due to the concern of being led astray, as seen in Exodus 34:16. This prohibition extends to participating in wedding feasts and celebrations of idolaters, as well as engaging in intimate relationships with non-Jews to maintain the purity of the Israelite lineage and loyalty to God. The Talmud emphasizes that the prohibition against intercourse with gentile women is a halakha from Sinai, not a rabbinic ordinance, with historical examples such as Pinehas and Zimri. The importance of spiritual purity and loyalty to God is highlighted in various biblical stories, such as Daniel and his friends' refusal to eat non-kosher food to maintain their faith. 

|אֱלֹהֵ֥י מַסֵּכָ֖ה לֹ֥א תַעֲשֶׂה־לָּֽךְ׃|17|You shall not make molten gods for yourselves.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that not relying on principles when one's heart has clear understanding is akin to idol worship, as seen in the example of Eliyahu at Mount Carmel. The prohibition against worshipping molten gods in Exodus 34:17 emphasizes turning exclusively to God for protection and guidance. Halakhah reiterates the prohibition against false gods in Leviticus 19:4 and Exodus 20:4, equating disrespecting holidays with idol worship. Kabbalah warns against impurity caused by negative thoughts and anger, likening it to building a personal altar to idolatry. Midrash emphasizes the importance of observing festivals and avoiding slander to avoid idolatry. Musar connects the prohibition of chametz on Passover with destroying the evil urge and idol worship, warning against spurning holidays. Quoting Commentary highlights various interpretations of the prohibition against idolatry, including the connection to observing the Feast of Matzot. Talmud teaches that disparaging the Festivals is akin to idol worship, and discusses laws regarding sancta and immersion for sancta vessels. The Targum commentary on Exodus 34:17 states that people should not make molten gods for themselves. 

|אֶת־חַ֣ג הַמַּצּוֹת֮ תִּשְׁמֹר֒ שִׁבְעַ֨ת יָמִ֜ים תֹּאכַ֤ל מַצּוֹת֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּיתִ֔ךָ לְמוֹעֵ֖ד חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָאָבִ֑יב כִּ֚י בְּחֹ֣דֶשׁ הָֽאָבִ֔יב יָצָ֖אתָ מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|18|You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread—eating unleavened bread for seven days, as I have commanded you—at the set time of the month  of Abib, for in the month of Abib you went forth from Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that the festival of matsot is a commemoration of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, while Halakhah discusses the length of a year and the division of months. Jewish Thought highlights the significance of the first five commandments and the importance of Passover and circumcision. Midrash discusses Moses' interaction with God and protection from evil, while Musar warns against working on festival days. The Talmud delves into interpretations of verses and distinctions between sancta and heave, emphasizing the importance of observing the Festivals. Targum explains the command to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the month of ripening grain to remember the exodus from Egypt. 

|כׇּל־פֶּ֥טֶר רֶ֖חֶם לִ֑י וְכׇֽל־מִקְנְךָ֙ תִּזָּכָ֔ר פֶּ֖טֶר שׁ֥וֹר וָשֶֽׂה׃|19|Every first issue of the womb is Mine, from all your livestock that drop a male  as firstling, whether cattle or sheep.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the significance of the month of Aviv, linking it to the word Av and the festival of Tisha B'Av. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Rashbam, Haamek Davar, Rashi, and Rav Hirsch discuss the laws and importance of redeeming firstborn sons. Halakhah outlines the commandment for a Jewish man to redeem his firstborn son and the counting of years until the Jubilee year. Midrash emphasizes the consecration of firstborn males and the significance of transferring them to the Lord. Quoting Commentary from Rabbeinu Bahya and the German Commentary on Mishnah Bekhorot discusses the sanctification of firstborns in Israel. Talmud addresses various rules regarding consecrated animals, produce, and firstborn obligations, while Tanakh specifies the redemption price for human first-borns. Targum emphasizes the consecration of all first-born animals, mentioning cattle and sheep. 

|וּפֶ֤טֶר חֲמוֹר֙ תִּפְדֶּ֣ה בְשֶׂ֔ה וְאִם־לֹ֥א תִפְדֶּ֖ה וַעֲרַפְתּ֑וֹ כֹּ֣ל בְּכ֤וֹר בָּנֶ֙יךָ֙ תִּפְדֶּ֔ה וְלֹֽא־יֵרָא֥וּ פָנַ֖י רֵיקָֽם׃|20|But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every male first-born among your children. None shall appear before Me empty-handed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Parsha Ki Tisa, the twelve tribes are each associated with a specific point of guarding, compassion comes from God, and giving to those in need is encouraged. The redemption of firstborn sons and donkeys is outlined in Numbers 18:16 and Exodus 34:20, with specific values and processes for redemption. The Halakhah mandates the redemption of a firstling donkey with a sheep, and the Midrash discusses the significance of these redemptions and blessings. The Mishnah addresses exemptions and priorities in mitzvot, while the Talmud delves into the requirements for redeeming firstborn animals. Rabbinic commentaries explore interpretations and deeper meanings of these laws, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling commandments and Torah wisdom. 

|שֵׁ֤שֶׁת יָמִים֙ תַּעֲבֹ֔ד וּבַיּ֥וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֖י תִּשְׁבֹּ֑ת בֶּחָרִ֥ישׁ וּבַקָּצִ֖יר תִּשְׁבֹּֽת׃|21|Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor; you shall cease from labor even at plowing time and harvest time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the need for receptacles to receive G'd's largesse, which is facilitated by observing the Sabbath rest, as seen in Deuteronomy 15:15. Commentary underscores the priority of Sabbath observance over agricultural tasks like plowing and harvesting, even during crucial times for farmers. Halakhah details the commandments for resting from agricultural work in the Sabbatical year and Jubilee, with debate over exemptions for Jews in outer space or polar areas. Liturgy connects Sabbath observance to redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, promising rewards for those who properly observe the Sabbath. Midrash explains the prohibition of kindling a fire on the Sabbath, while Mishnah discusses the reading of Torah incidents in public and restrictions on plowing and harvesting in the Sabbatical year. Quoting Commentary clarifies the interpretation of Exodus 34:21 in relation to plowing and harvesting during the Sabbatical year. Talmud delves into the prohibitions and requirements for agricultural labor during the Sabbatical Year, with a focus on the holiness of the Land of Israel. Targum translations of Exodus 34:21 stress the importance of resting on the seventh day and abstaining from plowing and harvesting. 

|וְחַ֤ג שָׁבֻעֹת֙ תַּעֲשֶׂ֣ה לְךָ֔ בִּכּוּרֵ֖י קְצִ֣יר חִטִּ֑ים וְחַג֙ הָֽאָסִ֔יף תְּקוּפַ֖ת הַשָּׁנָֽה׃|22|You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the first fruits of the wheat harvest; and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The World to Come in Chasidut is described as beyond time, with transcendent perceptions attained through makifim being the main pleasure for those who merit them. The Festival of Ingathering (Sukkot) marks the turn of the year and involves celebrating the harvest, with festivals like Sukkot and Shavuot emphasizing internalizing service to God. Halakhah focuses on aligning lunar and solar years through intercalation to ensure holidays fall at their proper times, with Sukkot being known as the Festival of Ingathering. The Talmud discusses interpretations of verses regarding the intercalation of the year and the order of offerings during festivals like Shavuot. Tanakh instructs bringing new grain offerings to God on the Feast of Weeks. 

|שָׁלֹ֥שׁ פְּעָמִ֖ים בַּשָּׁנָ֑ה יֵרָאֶה֙ כׇּל־זְכ֣וּרְךָ֔ אֶת־פְּנֵ֛י הָֽאָדֹ֥ן ׀ יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|23|Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Sovereign יהוה, the God of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The pilgrimage festivals in Jerusalem are commanded in the Torah for males to appear before God, bringing offerings and celebrating, with women exempt from some obligations. The festivals symbolize the unique relationship between God and the people of Israel, reflecting Isaac as an unblemished offering. The Talmud discusses exemptions from commandments for women, slaves, and minors, while the Tosefta addresses exemptions for the unclean and blind from appearing at the Temple during festivals. 

|כִּֽי־אוֹרִ֤ישׁ גּוֹיִם֙ מִפָּנֶ֔יךָ וְהִרְחַבְתִּ֖י אֶת־גְּבֻלֶ֑ךָ וְלֹא־יַחְמֹ֥ד אִישׁ֙ אֶֽת־אַרְצְךָ֔ בַּעֲלֹֽתְךָ֗ לֵרָאוֹת֙ אֶת־פְּנֵי֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ שָׁלֹ֥שׁ פְּעָמִ֖ים בַּשָּׁנָֽה׃|24|I will drive out nations from your path and enlarge your territory; no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before your God יהוה three times a year.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God will protect Israel's land during pilgrimages due to their obedience and population growth, exempting women and servants from appearing before God on festivals for safety reasons. The Torah warns against individual heresy and emphasizes personal conduct, with divine protection promised for those on religious missions. The Gemara explains that property will be safeguarded during Festivals, and God promises to enlarge Israel's territory and drive out nations to prevent coveting of their land. 

|לֹֽא־תִשְׁחַ֥ט עַל־חָמֵ֖ץ דַּם־זִבְחִ֑י וְלֹא־יָלִ֣ין לַבֹּ֔קֶר זֶ֖בַח חַ֥ג הַפָּֽסַח׃|25|You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened; and the sacrifice of the Feast of Passover shall not be left lying until morning.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against leaving the Passover offering until morning applies to the whole offering, including the flesh and fat, with Onkelos translating it as applying only to the fat to be burnt on the altar. Rashi explains that an offering left overnight is not invalidated if placed on top of the altar, and the sacrifice of the Passover feast refers to the sacrificial portions. The verse from Exodus 34:25 prohibits sacrificing blood with leavened bread and requires the Passover offering to be eaten before morning. Rabbi Yishmael explains that leaven must be removed from homes before the eve of the festival, not on the day of the festival itself, as indicated by the prohibition against slaughtering the Paschal lamb with leaven still present. Rava explains that leaven must be removed before slaughtering the Paschal lamb based on Exodus 34:25. The Targum commentary on Exodus 34:25 states that the Pesach-offering must not be slaughtered with chometz present, and the fats of the offering should not be left on the altar overnight. 

|רֵאשִׁ֗ית בִּכּוּרֵי֙ אַדְמָ֣תְךָ֔ תָּבִ֕יא בֵּ֖ית יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ לֹא־תְבַשֵּׁ֥ל גְּדִ֖י בַּחֲלֵ֥ב אִמּֽוֹ׃|26|The choice first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of your God יהוה. You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the commandment to bring firstfruits to the Temple and the prohibition against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, emphasizing the importance of following these laws and understanding their implications. The prohibition of mixing meat with milk includes cooking, eating, and deriving any benefit from the mixture, with specific guidelines on what is allowed and forbidden. The text also addresses the significance of showing regard for all beings and fulfilling duties towards humanity and God, as well as the importance of understanding and observing the Torah through oral tradition and decrees of the sages. Additionally, the Talmud clarifies the prohibition of deriving benefit from meat cooked in milk and outlines various scenarios where certain items are forbidden for use, such as in marriage gifts or First Fruits offerings. The Tanakh provides specific instructions on bringing first fruits to God and avoiding certain practices, while the Tosefta details the liabilities associated with cooking and eating forbidden mixtures. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה כְּתׇב־לְךָ֖ אֶת־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה כִּ֞י עַל־פִּ֣י ׀ הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה כָּרַ֧תִּי אִתְּךָ֛ בְּרִ֖ית וְאֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|27|And יהוה said to Moses: Write down these commandments, for in accordance with these commandments I make a covenant with you and with Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

G-d commanded Moses to write the renewed covenant with the people, emphasizing forgiveness for sins and warnings against idolatry and intermarriage. Positive Mitzvot 125 states first fruits must be brought to God's house, and Shev Shmateta stresses the importance of guarding one's speech. Knowing the Mishnah by heart connects one with God's unity, and the covenant of Understanding, the Living God, and Lordship is essential for grasping the Torah. The Torah was given in stages to Moses, symbolizing reconciliation and differentiation from idolaters. Ramban emphasizes all commandments were ordained at Sinai, and Talmud discusses the importance of both oral and written transmission of the Torah. Adonoy instructs Moses to write down the covenant between him and the B'nei Yisrael. 

|וַֽיְהִי־שָׁ֣ם עִם־יְהֹוָ֗ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יוֹם֙ וְאַרְבָּעִ֣ים לַ֔יְלָה לֶ֚חֶם לֹ֣א אָכַ֔ל וּמַ֖יִם לֹ֣א שָׁתָ֑ה וַיִּכְתֹּ֣ב עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֗ת אֵ֚ת דִּבְרֵ֣י הַבְּרִ֔ית עֲשֶׂ֖רֶת הַדְּבָרִֽים׃|28|And he was there with יהוה forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread and drank no water; and he wrote down on the tablets the terms of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Moses's spiritual consumption, surviving on spiritual nourishment during his time on Mount Sinai, while Halakhah discusses the resurrection of the dead and the righteous enjoying the Shekhinah without physical sustenance. Jewish Thought explores the levels of attainment in philosophy and metaphysics, and Kabbalah emphasizes the importance of Torah study. Midrash recounts Moses's fasting and teaching Torah without eating or drinking, and Musar emphasizes acquiring wisdom over material possessions. The Talmud debates whether Moses died or not, and the Second Temple text mentions Moses renouncing bodily pleasures during divine communications. The Targum states that Moses wrote the Ten Commandments after spending forty days and nights without eating or drinking before God. 

|וַיְהִ֗י בְּרֶ֤דֶת מֹשֶׁה֙ מֵהַ֣ר סִינַ֔י וּשְׁנֵ֨י לֻחֹ֤ת הָֽעֵדֻת֙ בְּיַד־מֹשֶׁ֔ה בְּרִדְתּ֖וֹ מִן־הָהָ֑ר וּמֹשֶׁ֣ה לֹֽא־יָדַ֗ע כִּ֥י קָרַ֛ן ע֥וֹר פָּנָ֖יו בְּדַבְּר֥וֹ אִתּֽוֹ׃|29|So Moses came down from Mount Sinai. And as Moses came down from the mountain bearing the two tablets of the Pact, Moses was not aware that the skin of his face was radiant, since he had spoken with God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses' radiant face symbolizes redemption from sin and closeness to God, earned through humility and prophecy, as seen in various commentaries, Midrashim, and Talmudic discussions. The Sabbath and Tabernacle offer glimpses of the World to Come, with Moses embodying a return to innocence and a bridge between the earthly and heavenly realms, reflecting the blending of body and soul in holiness. Moses' unique qualities and role in the construction of the tabernacle are emphasized, highlighting his significance in Jewish thought and liturgy. 

|וַיַּ֨רְא אַהֲרֹ֜ן וְכׇל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֔ה וְהִנֵּ֥ה קָרַ֖ן ע֣וֹר פָּנָ֑יו וַיִּֽירְא֖וּ מִגֶּ֥שֶׁת אֵלָֽיו׃|30|Aaron and all the Israelites saw that the skin of Moses’ face was radiant; and they shrank from coming near him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how Miriam shamed Moses, affecting his radiance and perfection of senses, symbolizing fear of God. Commentary discusses Moses' radiance as a sign of his spiritual status and connection to God, earned after the sin of the golden calf. Halakhah distinguishes Moses' prophecy from others, emphasizing his mental power and separation from worldly desires. Kabbalah links the loss of spiritual connection to the evil snake and death, while Midrash discusses blessings, Moses' reverence, and consequences of sin. Musar highlights the importance of purification and sanctification, comparing Moses and Joshua's leadership qualities. Quoting various commentators, Sforno, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, Rashbam, and Chizkuni offer insights on Moses' radiant face and interactions with God. Talmud and Targum both mention Moses concealing his face, leading to its radiance and others' fear of approaching him. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֤א אֲלֵהֶם֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה וַיָּשֻׁ֧בוּ אֵלָ֛יו אַהֲרֹ֥ן וְכׇל־הַנְּשִׂאִ֖ים בָּעֵדָ֑ה וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר מֹשֶׁ֖ה אֲלֵהֶֽם׃|31|But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the chieftains in the assembly returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses spoke to the Israelites after they saw the beams of glory streaming from his face, Aaron and the princes returned to Moses, who spoke words of peace and forgiveness, the people initially turned away from Moses out of fear but then turned back to face him. The text discusses the order in which the congregation and chiefs are to gather, with the chiefs taking precedence in speaking, R. Jonathan explains that Moses' humility ultimately leads to the forgiveness of the Israelites for worshipping the golden calf. Rashi explains that Moses first taught the laws about vows to the princes of Israel before teaching the rest of the people, showing vows should be annulled by an expert in the Law unless there is no expert available. Moses instructs the leaders of the Israelite tribes that if a man makes a vow to יהוה or swears an oath, he must fulfill it; however, if a woman makes a vow or oath, it can be annulled by her father or husband if he objects on the day he hears about it. Moshe called Aharon and the leaders of the congregation, and spoke to them. 

|וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵ֥ן נִגְּשׁ֖וּ כׇּל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיְצַוֵּ֕ם אֵת֩ כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אִתּ֖וֹ בְּהַ֥ר סִינָֽי׃|32|Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he instructed them concerning all that יהוה had imparted to him on Mount Sinai.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructed the children of Israel on the construction of the Tabernacle, priestly garments, and other commandments from Mount Sinai, covering his face with a scarf to shield the light. After receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses interceded for Israel's forgiveness, leading to the establishment of Yom Kippur as a day of atonement. Moses taught the elders, then the people, about vows and contributions, with the importance of Torah experts highlighted. The covenant at Mount Sinai and the laws given there were emphasized by Ramban. 

|וַיְכַ֣ל מֹשֶׁ֔ה מִדַּבֵּ֖ר אִתָּ֑ם וַיִּתֵּ֥ן עַל־פָּנָ֖יו מַסְוֶֽה׃|33|And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses wore a veil over his face when speaking to the Israelites to prevent them from being overwhelmed by the radiance of his face and to emphasize the importance of the divine message. Aaron embraced his role as a divine emissary and wore priestly vestments to enhance his authority. Moses lost his radiant light when taken before Pharaoh but regained it when receiving the Torah on Mount Sinai, wearing a veil to shield the Israelites from his intense light until his death. Tur HaArokh, Ramban, and Ibn Ezra offer different interpretations of the significance of Moses covering his face with a cloth, with Targum stating that he put a veil over his face after speaking with the people. 

|וּבְבֹ֨א מֹשֶׁ֜ה לִפְנֵ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ לְדַבֵּ֣ר אִתּ֔וֹ יָסִ֥יר אֶת־הַמַּסְוֶ֖ה עַד־צֵאת֑וֹ וְיָצָ֗א וְדִבֶּר֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֵ֖ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְצֻוֶּֽה׃|34|Whenever Moses went in before יהוה to converse, he would leave the veil off until he came out; and when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses removed the veil from his face when communicating with God or the people to show humility and focus on the teachings rather than his radiance, symbolizing the sanctity of divine communication. The Midrash emphasizes Moses' role as a messenger for the people and the importance of humility in communication with God. Ramban explains the significance of the Tabernacle and the Divine Glory filling it, with Rabbeinu Bahya discussing the symbolism of offerings at Mount Sinai. In Targum, Moses removed the veil before speaking with God and relayed commands to the Israelites. 

|וְרָא֤וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶת־פְּנֵ֣י מֹשֶׁ֔ה כִּ֣י קָרַ֔ן ע֖וֹר פְּנֵ֣י מֹשֶׁ֑ה וְהֵשִׁ֨יב מֹשֶׁ֤ה אֶת־הַמַּסְוֶה֙ עַל־פָּנָ֔יו עַד־בֹּא֖וֹ לְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתּֽוֹ׃|35|the Israelites would see how radiant the skin of Moses’ face was. Moses would then put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses veiled his face when not speaking with God, symbolizing his spiritual progress and emphasizing his intimate relationship with God. The Midrash discusses the consequences of sin and the symbolism of cups, highlighting the ten horns given to Israel by God. The Golden Calf episode portrays the people of Israel as stubborn and untrusting, showcasing the complex relationships between the people, their leader, and God. Abaye and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa propose solutions for reading portions out of sequence in the Talmud, and God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife in the Tanakh. The Targum notes that the B'nei Yisrael saw Moses' radiant face and he covered it with a veil when not speaking with God.
