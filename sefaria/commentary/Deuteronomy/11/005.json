And you should know this day, that it is not with your children who have not known and who did not experience the chastisement of Adonoy, your God, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm. His signs and His deeds that He performed in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land. And what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Sea of Reeds drown them as they pursued you, and Adonoy destroyed them to this very day. And what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came into this place. And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel. But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of Adonoy, that He performed. You should [therefore] keep all the commandments which I command you this day, so you will be strong, and go in and possess the land, to which you are passing over to possess it. And in order to prolong your days upon the land Adonoy swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring; a land flowing with milk and honey.", "versionTitle": "Translation based on the Metsudah linear siddur, by Avrohom Davis, 1981", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "6037a6f9cda51cfa3ddf3f7d", "index_title": "Ramban on Deuteronomy", "category": "Quoting Commentary", "type": "", "ref": "Ramban on Deuteronomy 11:2:1", "anchorRef": "Deuteronomy 11:5", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Deuteronomy 11:5"], "sourceRef": "Ramban on Deuteronomy 11:2:1", "sourceHeRef": "רמב\"ן על דברים י״א:ב׳:א׳", "anchorVerse": 5, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1246, 1286], "commentaryNum": 2.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Ramban on Deuteronomy", "he": "רמב\"ן על דברים"}, "he": "<b>אֶת גָּדְלוֹ אֶת יָדוֹ הַחֲזָקָה וּזְרֹעוֹ הַנְּטוּיָה</b>, אָמַר ר\"א (אבן עזרא על דברים י\"א:ב') לְהוֹצִיא אֶתְכֶם מִמִּצְרַיִם וְהָאוֹתוֹת וְהַמּוֹפְתִים שֶׁעָשָׂה לְפַרְעֹה, וַאֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה לָכֶם בַּמִּדְבָּר בִּדְבַר הַמָּן. וְאֵינֶנּוּ נָכוֹן בְּעֵינַי, כִּי עַתָּה לֹא יְדַבֵּר רַק בַּמּוּסָר אֲשֶׁר יְיַסֵּר בּוֹ הַשֵּׁם לְעוֹבְרֵי רְצוֹנוֹ, אֶת גָּדְלוֹ, שֶׁהָיָה מִתְרוֹמֵם וּמִתְגַּדֵּל לֵאמֹר הִתְפָּאֵר עָלַי (שמות ח ה), לְמָחָר יִהְיֶה (שם פסוק יט), וְשַׂמְתִּי פְדוּת (שם), לְמַעַן תֵּדַע כִּי לַה' הָאָרֶץ (שם ט כט). וְאֶת יָדוֹ הַחֲזָקָה, וְשָׁלַחְתִּי אֶת יָדִי וְהִכֵּיתִי אֶת מִצְרַיִם (שם ג כ), אֶת הַיָּד הַגְּדֹלָה אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה ה' (שם יד לא). וּזְרוֹעוֹ הַנְּטוּיָה, שֶׁלֹּא נָתַן לָהֶם רֶוַח וְהַצָּלָה מֵאָז הָיְתָה יָדוֹ נְטוּיָה עֲלֵיהֶם, וְלֹא הֵשִׁיב יָדוֹ מִבַּלֵּעַ עַד שֶׁאִבְּדָם. וַאֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה לָכֶם בַּמִּדְבָּר (דברים י\"א:ה'), אֲשֶׁר נָגַף אֶתְכֶם בָּעֵגֶל וְאֵשׁ תַּבְעֵרָה וְהַנְּחָשִׁים הַשְּׂרָפִים וְקִבְרוֹת הַתַּאֲוָה וּמַגֵּפַת הַשִּׁטִּים וּגְזֵרַת הַמְרַגְּלִים, שֶׁהָיְתָה בָּהֶם יַד ה' עַד בּוֹאָם אֶל הַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה. וְקִצֵּר בַּפֻּרְעָנוּת שֶׁעָשָׂה לָהֶם. וְאִם כֵּן וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם אֶת כָּל הַמִּצְוָה לְמַעַן תֶּחֶזְקוּ, כִּי יָדוֹ הַחֲזָקָה מַחְזֶקֶת שׁוֹמְרֵי מִצְוֹתָיו וְלֹא יַחֲזִיק בְּיַד מְרֵעִים:", "heVersionTitle": "Vocalized Edition", "heLicense": "", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "HIS GREATNESS, HIS MIGHTY HAND, AND HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM.

Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry.", "An ancient name for Deuteronomy, <i>mishne tora</i>—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.”", "From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners.", "The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion.", "Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature.", "Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books).", "But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright,", "the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were.", "It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal.", "That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 <small>B.C.E.</small>) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem.", "It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.”", "The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the L<small>ORD</small> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the L<small>ORD</small> … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version)", "What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king", "directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the L<small>ORD</small>. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the L<small>ORD</small>, to follow the L<small>ORD</small>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3)", "The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy.", "The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be.", "The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world.", "In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century <small>B.C.E.</small>, which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24.", "Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process).", "Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of <i>one God</i> for <i>one people</i> in <i>one land</i> observing <i>one cult</i>” (italics his).", "Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines:", "I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43)", "A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3)", "B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43)", "II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36)", "Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai", "III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28)", "A   The Laws (12–26)", "B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28)", "IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30)", "Looking Ahead to Exile and Return", "V  Final Matters (31–34)", "A   Passing the Mantle (31)", "B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32)", "C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33)", "D   The End (34)", "A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God.", "It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

To keep the commandments of Adonoy and His decrees, which I command you this day. Behold, the heaven and the highest of heavens belong to Adonoy, your God, the earth and all that is in it. Yet only in your fathers did Adonoy delight, to love them, and He chose their offspring after them, even you among all the peoples as [it is] this day. Circumcise the barrier of your heart, and be stiffnecked no longer. For Adonoy, your God, is God of all powers and the Master of all masters, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, Who has no regard for personages and takes no bribes. Who does justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You must love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You must fear Adonoy, your God, serve Him, cleave to Him, and swear by His Name. He is your praise, and He is your God, Who did with you all these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. With seventy people your fathers descended to Egypt, and now Adonoy, your God, has made you as abundant as the stars of heaven. [Therefore] you shall love Adonoy, your God, and keep His trust, His decrees, His statutes, and His commandments all the days. And you should know this day, that it is not with your children who have not known and who did not experience the chastisement of Adonoy, your God, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm. His signs and His deeds that He performed in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land. And what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how He made the water of the Sea of Reeds drown them as they pursued you, and Adonoy destroyed them to this very day. And what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came into this place. And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel. But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of Adonoy, that He performed. You should [therefore] keep all the commandments which I command you this day, so you will be strong, and go in and possess the land, to which you are passing over to possess it.

It is in this respect that Moses said to the Jews: \"What does the L-rd your G-d ask of you…\" For this thing depends upon you and it is very easy in terms of the power of your intellect; for its nature inclines towards it and it is easy to attain all things for which there is a natural inclination. And if you should contend: True, this may be easy for intellect, but it is very difficult for imagination to acquiesce in this, for it is drawn after the images it forms of the things of this world, and man, whose source is dust is drawn after it — to this Moses counters: \"And know this today, for it is not your children who have not known and who have not seen the chastisement of the L-rd your G-d.\" That is, if I were speaking with your children, who did not know and who did not witness punitive retribution in this world, they could say that their imaginations enticed them into seeing the successes of the world as eternal, for they had not seen G-d overturning the seats of kingdom to execute His justice against the transgressors of His will. But you, you have seen the chastisements of your G-d, how could you be enticed by imagination? Have you not seen how the L-rd dashed to the earth and glory of Egypt that was ensconced in might? And you saw, too, how many punishments G-d brought upon you in the desert for your own sins. This is the intent of (Devarim 11:5): \"And what He did to you in the desert until you came to this place\" (Moses does not elaborate here and speaks only in general terms in deference to the honor of the Jews). And you saw, too, what he did to Dathan and Aviram… And you cannot say that this was a natural phenomenon (fissures sometimes occurring in the earth), for they were \"in the midst of all of Israel,\" and they alone perished in their sin. And since (Ibid 7) \"your own eyes have seen all of the acts of the great [and awesome] L-rd,\" you should not be enticed by this world at all. It is for this reason that Dathan and Aviram are mentioned, and not Korach, the central figure in the rebellion; for man's imagination craves the lusts and pleasures of this world not for himself alone, but to bequeath them to his children — to the point that this constitutes the major objective of most men, so that they give almost no thought to themselves. They infest their souls with sin and heap up transgressions so that they can cause their children to inherit their palaces and dwellings. But this inheritance is a \"hasty one, which shall not be blessed with endurance\" (see Proverbs 20:21) — so that sometimes, at a man's very height, the fortune he amassed unjustly will leave him in the middle of his days (see Jeremiah 17:11), and he will be left with his transgression alone.", "versionTitle": "Derashot HaRan, by Rabbi Shraga Silverstein", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": "דרשות הר\"ן, מתורגמות בידי רבי שרגא סילברשטיין"}, {"_id": "5892f2d7d6e4a927464728fa", "index_title": "Chizkuni", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 11:5:1", "anchorRef": "Deuteronomy 11:5", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Deuteronomy 11:5"], "sourceRef": "Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 11:5:1", "sourceHeRef": "חזקוני, דברים י״א:ה׳:א׳", "anchorVerse": 5, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1220, 1260], "commentaryNum": 5.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Chizkuni", "he": "חזקוני"}, "heTitle": "דברים", "he": "<b>ואשר עשה לכם במדבר </b>בדבר המן.\n", "heVersionTitle": "Chizkuni", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "חזקוני", "text": "ואשר עשה לכם במדבר, “and what He did for you in the desert;” this is a reference to the manna.
