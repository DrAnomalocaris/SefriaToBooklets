Schmid, 1842", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "וגם הוא יגדל, he will also develop into becoming very numerous. However his younger brother will become even more numerous. At the Exodus from Egyptian the arms-bearing males of the tribe of Ephrayim were 45.500 (Numbers 1,33-35 as opposed to only 32.200 members of the tribe of Menashe. Interestingly, when numbering the males over 20 who entered the Holy Land, the members of the tribe of Menashe outnumbered those of Ephrayim by 52.700 to 32.500. (Numbers 26,34-36.) If we keep this in mind we may have to redefine the meaning of the word יגדל when used by Yaakov not as referring to numerical strength, but as referring to the great men produced by each of these tribes and the relative importance of these men. We know that Moses’ successor, Joshua, was from the tribe of Ephrayim. He was a great saviour, and conquered the land of Canaan enabling the promise of G’d to the patriarchs to finally become realised. The tribe of Ephrayim also provided the first king of the 10 tribes who had split away from Solomon’s son Rechavam after the death of Solomon.  Furthermore, throughout the history of the Jewish people until the destruction of the first Temple the political rivalry between Ephrayim and Yehudah is well documented, whereas hardly ever is Menashe mentioned as playing a major part in this. When the prophet Isaiah prophesied an idyllic future, he described this as being characterised by the end of the rivalry between Ephrayim and Yehudah. (Isaiah 11,13). Still, it is possible to also understand the word יגדל ממנו as referring to numerical strength, as except in the single instance we mentioned before Ephrayim always outnumbered Menashe. We must also take into consideration the words וזרעו יהיה מלא הגויים, “and his seed will become plentiful enough to form nations.” The unique phenomenon of the members of Ephrayim being inferior in numbers at the time the Israelites entered the Holy Land may possibly be accounted for by the tradition that 30 years prior to the Exodus the tribe of Ephrayim rebelled, left Egypt and marched to the land of the Philistines on the way to the land of Canaan. According to that report they lost 200.000 of their number in a battle at Gat. [the reason why I do not think this relevant is that if so, there should have been fewer member of the tribe of Ephrayim at the time of the Exodus, instead of 40 years later when near entering the Holy Land.

The <i>Maftir</i> (the <i>Haftarah</i> section from the Prophets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Haftarah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">הפטרה</span>, is a portion from the Prophets section of the Bible read after the Torah is read on Sabbaths, festivals, and fast days. On Sabbaths and festivals the <i>haftarah</i> is read during the Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service (see footnote 17), but on fast days it is read only during the Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> Service (see footnote 40). The exception to this is Yom Kippur and <i>Tishah be-Av</i> (see footnote 102) where there is a <i>haftarah</i> after the Torah reading in both the Morning and the Afternoon Service.<br>The Torah in its regular portions is read straight through during the year but such is not the case on festivals and some special Sabbaths. The <i>haftarot</i> are selected in parts from both the Former and Latter Prophets. Only two prophetic books are read in their entirety as <i>haftarot</i>, the Book of Obadiah which has only twenty-one verses and is read after the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishlaḥ</i> (Genesis 32:4-36-43) according to the Sephardi rite, and the Book of Jonah which is the <i>haftarah</i> for the <i>Minḥah</i> Service on Yom Kippur (see the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 622:2).<br><i>Haftarot</i> were usually selected so there would be some similarity in content between the Pentateuchal and the Prophetic portions, but often this did not happen and <i>haftarot</i> were chosen because of historical events or because of some special date. Special <i>haftarot</i> are read on special Sabbaths and the <i>haftarah</i> for each festival is based on the nature of the festival.<br>When the custom of reading the <i>haftarah</i> got started is not known for sure, but it is thought that it began during the persecutions of the Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Hasmonean revolt. The Torah was not permitted to be read by the Jews during the persecution for it was felt that the reading of it kept the Jews together and gave them a special strength. As a substitute for the Torah reading, sections form the Prophets were chosen that would remind the Jews of the corresponding Torah portion. Appearantly when the ban against reading the Torah was lifted, the practice of reading the <i>haftarah</i> continued. The first mention of the practice of the reading of the <i>haftarah</i> is found in the New Testament. Acts 13:15 states, \"after the reading of the law and the prophets\". <i>Haftarot</i> are also discussed in the Talmud as to which are to be read at specific times and festivals. In Mishnaic times different communities read different <i>haftarot</i>, and a set order was probably not established until talmudic times. Some <i>haftarot</i> today differ from those recorded in the Talmud, and there are differences in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites.<br>The <i>maftir</i>, the one who reads the <i>haftarah</i> also reads the last part of the weekly portion, (i.e., the Torah reader reads it for him). On the Sabbath, after the seventh reader from the Torah, the <i>maftir</i> usually rereads the last three verses of the weekly portion. On festivals and the four special Sabbaths, the <i>maftir</i> reads the special section from the second scroll which is usually a short description of of the festival found in the Torah. Before the <i>haftarah</i> is read (or chanted) the <i>maftir</i> precedes the <i>haftarah</i> with two blessings and after he ends the <i>haftarah</i> he recites three blessings to which a fourth one is added on Sabbaths and festivals. This fourth blessing changes with the nature of the day. The Sabbath <i>haftarah</i> usually has a minimum of twenty-one verses while the festival has at least fifteen verses. Lately it has become the custom for the Bar Mitzvah boy (a man upon reaching the age of thirteen) to chant the <i>haftarah</i> to display his ability with a Hebrew text.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 16, pp. 1342-44.</i>) comes from Isaiah, “and shall say, cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way” until “for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it”, (Isaiah 57:14-58:14).", "versionTitle": "Hilkhot Yom ha-Kippurim, trans. by Jan M.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered.", "As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee.", "The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.", "Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

Während es bei den meisten übrigen einfach heißt: אלה משפחת וגו׳ לפקדיהם, bildet hier bei Menasche und dem folgenden Benjamin die Konstruktion zwei Sätze: אלה משפחת וגו׳ ופקדיהם, und gibt damit das Ergebnis der Zählung zu besonderer Erwägung. Bedenken wir, daß die Gesamtvolkszahl sich um einige Tausend vermindert hatte, daß dieser Zählung das Aussterben aller über zwanzig Jahre alten יוצאי מצרים, sowie das wiederholte Sterben von קברות התאוה, nach Korachs Aufstand, durch die נחשים השרפים, bei Peor, vorangegangen, so dürfte in der erhöhten Volkszahl eines Stammes ein ehrenvolles Zeugnis für bewährte Pflichttreue liegen. Diese Erwägung kommt aber namentlich den beiden Stämmen Menasche und Benjamin zu gute. Sie waren bei der ersten Zählung entschieden die kleinsten an Volkszahl, und hatte Menasche die größte Zunahme, über zwanzigtausend, Benjamin doch über zehntausend aufzuweisen. Benjamin wird nur von Jissachar, mit neunzehntausend, und von Ascher, mit dreizehntausend übertroffen. Wir halten es nicht für unwahrscheinlich, daß hierin das Motiv dieser veränderten Konstruktion bei Menasche und Benjamin liegen dürfte. Bei Naftali (V. 50) steht auch ופקדיהם, obgleich es nur um eintausend sich vermehrt hatte, wohl weil damit die Zählung schließt, ebenso wie bei Reuben der Anfang der Zählung (V. 7) durch einen besonderen Satz ויהיו פקדיהם berichtet wird.

התחלתם בפרשת פנחס אמר שמה (במדבר כ\"ו נ\"ד נ\"ו) וידבר ה' אל משה לאמר, לאלה תחלק הארץ בנחלה במספר שמות לרב תרבה נחלתו ולמעט תמעיט נחלתו איש לפי פקודיו יותן נחלתו, אך בגורל יחלק את הארץ לשמות מטות אבותם ינחלו, על פי הגורל תחלק נחלתו בין רב למעט, הנה במה שאמר לרב תרבה נחלתו ולמעט תמעיט יראה שלא היה הרבוי והמיעוט על פי הגורל כדברי רש\"י, שאם היה כן לא היה מצות המנחילים שלרב ירבו ולמעט ימעיטו, מאחר שהוא מפורש על פי הגורל, ואינו גם כן כדעת הרמב\"ן שהפסוקים בשני חלוקים ידברו, כי לדבריו ראוי שיקדם במצותו החלוק הראשון שהוא לשבטים בשוה על פי הגורל, ואחריו יזכיר החלוק השני שיעשה במשפחות כפי מה שהם, והענין בכתוב בהפך זה, כי אמרו לאלה תחלק הארץ פירשו הרב על החלוק השני מהמשפחות שצוה עליו הוא ראשונה, ואמרו עוד אך בגורל יחלק את הארץ פירשו על החלוק הראשון מחלוקת הארץ לשבטים, ובא א\"כ החלוק השני ראשונה והראשון באחרונה אשר לא כדת. אבל האמת הוא כמו שהנחתי שהפרשה מחלוקת הארץ ידבר כלה, וצוה לאלה יחלק הארץ שלשבטים תחלק הארץ ולא בשוה כי אם לרב יתנו חלק רב ולמעט חלק מעט, וזהו איש לפי פקודיו יותן נחלתו, ואמר במספר שמות השבטים כפי מה שהם, ואמנם החלוקות הפרטיות מהמשפחות ומבתי אבות ומהגברים לא זכרם התורה, כי היו מהשכל האנשים לעשותם לגלגלותם, ונסתפק לבד לצוות על החלוקה הכוללת, כי היה הכוונה שמה אחרי ידיעת רבוי כל שבט ושבט שיתחלק הארץ אליהם כפי מה שהם מהרבוי והמיעוט במנינם. ולפי שמזה ימשך הספק במנחילים ויאמרו עם היות שאנחנו נגביל את כמות הארץ מי יגביל איכותה, ואיך יתפייס השבט אשר יפול חלקו בגליל לאשר יותן חלקו בעכה, הנה להתיר הספק הזה אמר מיד אך בגורל יחלק את הארץ, ר\"ל אך יהיה מפעל הגורל לבאר מקום השבטים בארץ, וזהו לשמות מטות אבותם, ר\"ל שבט פלוני במחוז פלוני ומטה פלוני בפלך פלוני, ואמר עוד על פי הגורל תחלק נחלתו בין רב למעט, לומר שלא יחשבו לתת לשבט הרב אשר נפל גורלו במחוז מובחר וטוב קצת חלקו במחוז ההוא וקצת ממנו במחוז אחר ופלך אחר, כי לכל השבט בין שיהיה רב האוכלוסין בין שיהיה מעט העם ינתן כל נחלתו וכל חלקו באותו מחוז אשר נפל שמה גורלו, וכן הפסוקים אשר בפ' אלה מסעי מסכימים לזה, אמר שם (שם ל\"ג נ\"ד) והתנחלתם את הארץ בגורל למשפחותיכם לרב תרבו נחלתו ולמעט תמעיטו את נחלתו אל אשר יצא שמה הגורל לו יהיה למטות אבותיכם תתנחלו, ר\"ל שצוה למנחילים את הארץ ב' דברים, האחד שיתנו אותם בגורל, והשני שיהיה למשפחותיהם, ובאר מיד מה דסמיך ליה איך יהיה למשפחותיהם, ואמר לרב תרבו וגו', ר\"ל כפי רבוי המשפחות יתנו שלרב ירבו ולמעט ימעיטו, וחזר וביאר ענין הגורל במה ישמש ולאיזה ענין יהיה, ואמר אל אשר יצא שמה הגורל לו יהיה וגו', ר\"ל שבמחוז ובפלך אשר יפול גורל כל שבט שם יהיה ושם יתנו לו נחלתו, ואמר עוד למטות אבותיכם תנחלו לומר שלא יחלקו מקום נחלת השבטים כאן חלק ממנו ובמקום אחר רחוק מזה חלק אחר, אבל למטות אבותיכם ינחלו שינתן לכל שבט ושבט נחלתו מדובקת ומחוברת במקום אשר נפל גורלו, וזה לפי שרצה הקב\"ה שיהיו כל השבטים סמוכים לעד לעולם בנחלתם. והנה זכרה התורה עוד שם גבולי הארץ ואמר בסופם (שם ל\"ד י\"ג) זאת הארץ אשר תתנחלו אותה בגורל אשר צוה ה' לתשעת המטות וחצי המטה, ואחר זה בא מיד פרשת אלה שמות האנשים אשר ינחלו לכם את הארץ, כי אחרי שצוה על החלוקה בגורל זכר המנחילים שיתנו החלקים כפי רוב העם ומיעוטו. הנה התבאר מזה שכל הפסוקים יסכימו בצואת חלוקת הארץ שני דברים. והם שיהיה מקום נחלת כל שבט כפי הגורל וכמות נחלתו כפי השערת האנשים המנחילים את הארץ, שיתנו חלק רב לשבט רב העם וחלק מעט לשבט מעט העם, ושלא היה רבוי החלק וכמותו על פי הגורל כדברי רש\"י ז\"ל, ולא נתחלקה הארץ לחלקים שוים כמו שחשב הרמב\"ן והרלב\"ג, ואין בזה סתירה ממה שאמר יעקב ליוסף (בראשית מ\"ח ה', ו') אפרים ומנשה כראובן ושמעון יהיו לי ומולדתך וגו' על שם אחיהם יקראו בנחלתם, כי היה כח הברכה שני ענינים, האחד שיתרבו שניהם כ\"כ שיהיו כשני שבטים וכן היה, שאתה מוצא בפרשת פנחס (במדבר כ\"ו ל\"ד, ל\"ז) שעלו פקודי אפרים ומנשה יותר מפקודי ראובן ושמעון, ומזה נמשך שנחלו בארץ כשני שבטים בחלק נחלתם, ולכן היה דין יוסף כדין הבכור נוטל פי שנים. והענין השני הוא כענין הבכור שיקראו שני בני יוסף שבטים, ורש\"י ז\"ל הרגיש וכיוון בדבריו שמה הענין השני הזה ותפס עליו הרמב\"ן, ואני במה שכללתי עמו הענין הראשון לא ישיגוני ספקותיו. הנה התבאר אמתת מה שהנחתי בדעת הזה וביטול דעת המפרשים מפסוקי התורה: ואמנם הסכמת זה למה שעשה יהושע מבואר נגלה, כי שם נאמר ויהי הגורל למטה בני יהודה למשפחותם אל מדבר צין וגומר, ולא אמר זה על חלוקת הארץ כי אם שיצא הגורל לבאר באיזה מקום ינחלו בני יהודה חלקם, ולזה זכר הגבולים ואחריו זכר הערים וחצריהם אשר נפלו אליהם בחלקם, וזהו ויהיו הערים למטה בני יהודה וגומר, והיה אם כן הגורל מה' כל משפטו, וכמות נחלת הארץ והערים מהשערת המנחילים את הארץ כפי רבוי העם, ומפני זה בקש כלב מיהושע שיתנו לו את חברון לפי שהיה ביד יהושע והמנחילים את הארץ לתתה עם היות שכיוון בזה דבר אחר כמו שאפרש בפסוקים. ועם זה תדע שמה שאמר אחר כן ויצא הגורל לבני יוסף, אינו שנפל חלקם בארץ יחד ושחלקו הם נחלתם ביניהם כמו שחשב הרמב\"ן, אבל היה שנפל הגורל בביאור המקום אשר יהיה בו נחלת אפרים ומנשה, כדי שיהיו שניהם שכנים בנחלתם ואיש אל רעהו יעזורו ולאחיו יאמר חזק. ואמרו וינחלו בני יוסף וגומר רצה בו שלקחו נחלתם כמו שיזכור מיד, שזכר נחלת אפרים בגבולים ובערים ואחריו אמר ויהי הגורל למטה מנשה וגומר, שרצה לומר פעם שנית שנפל גורלו באותו מחוז, והיה זה להגיד כי שתי גורלות הם שנפלו מביאור מקומות נחלתם לא גורל אחד, ואם אמר בתחלה ויהי הגורל לבני יוסף היה להודיע שבא מקום נחלת שניהם מחובר וסמוך זה לזה, ולזה אמר גורל בלשון יחיד עם היותם שני גורלות לאפרים ומנשה ששניהם נפלו יחד במחוז אחד מחובר, אמנם יהושע לכל אחד מהם הפיל גורל אחד ונתן נחלה נבדלת כפי העם אשר לו לאפרים בעצמו ולחצי מנשה בפני עצמו. וכאשר ידעת זה תדע למה צווחו בני יוסף אל יהושע מדוע נתת לי גורל אחד וחבל אחד ואני עם רב וגומר, מה שהוקשה מאד לכל המפרשים וילאו למצוא הפתח בפירושו, כי לפי שהיו יהושע והמנחילים את הארץ הם המרבים והממעטים הנחלות כפי השערותיהם בכמות כל שבט, לזה התרעמו שנתנו להם חלק מעט בהיותם עם רב ושלא שערו בהם כראוי, כי היה זה בידם ולא מהגורל, והנה יהושע לא התנצל מהם לומר שהיה זה דין ברור ומצות האל יתברך ולא עם הגורל ושלא היה בידו להרבות בנחלתם, אבל אמר שהרבה נחלה היה להם בשיתרחבו בה בהר ובארץ הפרזי והרפאים אשר נפל בחלקם שיכבשו אותה כדבר האלהים, ולכן אמרו הם גורל אחד וחבל אחד, כי היה הגורל לבאר מקום הנחלה והחבל הוא כמות הנחלה והחלק, וכמו שאפרש בפסוקים, ומפני זה אמר יהושע לשבעת השבטים שיתנו לו שלשה אנשים מכל שבט וישלחם לכתוב את הארץ לפי נחלתם ויתחלקו אותה לשבעה חלקים, ושהוא ישליך הגורל לפני ה' בשילה, והבן הפסוקים שלא אמר שהשלוחים יחלקו ויתנו את הארץ לשבטים, כי איך יקח יהושע מנחילים אחרים זולת האנשים אשר נקבו בשמות מהאל יתברך להנחיל את הארץ? ולא אמר שנחלקה הארץ אליהם בשוה, אבל היתה הכוונה שיתנו שלשה אנשים מכל שבט וישלחם וילכו בארץ ויכתבו הערים כפי הראוי לנחלתם. ושיכתבו הארץ שבעה חלקים, רוצה לומר שבעה מחוזות בפרט, כדי להשליך הגורל ולדעת כל שבט ושבט באיזה מקום ופלך יקח נחלתו, וגם יכתבו הערים כדי שידעו המנחילים מה יתנו לכל שבט ושבט, ואחר זה יהושע והמנחילים את הארץ יחלקו נחלתם ויתנו לכל שבט כמות הארץ הראויה אליו כפי כמות העם אשר לו, ולזה אמר ואתם תכתבו את הארץ שבעה חלקים והבאתם אלי ויריתי לכם גורל וגומר, שהם המחוזות והתחומין והערים גם כן, ולכן אמר בסוף הדברים וישלך להם יהושע גורל בשילה לפני ה' ויחלק את הארץ לפני ישראל במחלקותם, הנה אמר שהשליך הגורלות לפני ה' והיה זה באותם השבעה מחוזות שהביאו לפניו מהארץ, כדי לדעת המקום אשר יהיה שם נחלת כל שבט. ושמלבד זה חלק את הארץ אליהם, רוצה לומר לרב נחלה מרובה ולמעט מועטת, וזהו אמרו לבני ישראל במחלקותם, כלומר כפי החלוקה הראויה אליהם. ואמנם למה עשה זה בחלוקת הארץ השבעה שבטים, ולא בחלק יהודה ויוסף אדבר עליו ב\"ה בהיתר השאלה הרביעית. הנה התבאר מזה שספור המעשה וחלוקת הארץ יורה ויאמת מה שהנחתי, ושאין הענין כמו שחשבו המפרשים וזהו העיון השני:", "heVersionTitle": "Abarbanel, Tel Aviv 1960",

Genesis 1:16). Why, then, does the verse state: “And to rule during the day and at night”? Rather, it is referring to the righteous, who exert control over the body that was created to illuminate during the day and the body that was created to illuminate at night. That is what is written: “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance against their enemies. Is it not written in the book of the upright?” (Joshua 10:13). What is the book of the upright? It is the book of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis.</i> Why is it called the book of the upright? It is as it is written: “Let me die the death of the upright” (Numbers 23:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where “upright” alludes to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> Rabbi Ḥalafta applied it [this lesson] to here: “And to rule during the day and at night.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Rabbi Ilfa just said.</i> Rabbi Ḥanin in the name of Rabbi Shmuel applied it to the end of the book: “However, his younger brother [Ephraim] will be greater than he [Manasseh]” (Genesis 48:19). Is it possible to say this?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Manasseh’s descendants were more numerous than those of Ephraim (Numbers 26:34–37).</i> Rather, this refers Joshua, who would descend from him [Ephraim], who would cause the orbs of the sun and the moon, which rule from one end of the world to the other, to stand still.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And in that sense Ephraim was greater than Manasseh.</i>  <br>Rabbi Ḥanan in the name of Shmuel applied it to the end of the Torah, [where it is said of Joseph]: “A firstborn bull is his majesty…[he will gore the peoples together at the ends of the earth]” (Deuteronomy 33:17). Is it possible?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it possible that a king would arise from Joseph that would defeat kings throughout the world?

When the Holy One blessed be He appeared to him, he found him sitting with the book of Deuteronomy in his hand. He said to him: ‘“Be strong” Joshua, “be courageous” Joshua, “this book of the Torah shall not depart…”’ (Joshua 1:6–8). He took him and showed him to the orb of the sun. He [Joshua] said to it: ‘Just as I have not been still from [reading] this [book], so, you shall stand still before me.’ Thereupon, “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped” (Joshua 10:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He said to it: ‘Wayward slave, are you not the acquired possession of my ancestor [Joseph]? Did my ancestor not see you in a dream: “Behold, the sun and the moon…[were prostrating themselves to me]”?’ (Genesis 37:9).
