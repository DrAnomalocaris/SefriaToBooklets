T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.", "There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”", "Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

"text": "What is written after the matter? “The priest who is greater  than his brethren” (Leviticus 21:10); why is he called the High  Priest?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, literally, the Great Priest.</i> It is because he is great regarding five matters: Wisdom, strength, beauty, wealth, and years. In beauty, that he is fairer than his brethren; in power, that he is physically strong. Come and see; when Aaron waved twenty-two thousand Levites, he waved them on one day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 8:5–22. </i> How did he wave them? He would wave to and fro [to each side], and raise and lower them; that is, that he was great in strength. <br>In wealth, from where is it derived that if he was not wealthy, that his brethren, the priests, make him wealthy? There was an incident involving Pinḥas the stonemason, that they appointed him High Priest. His brethren, the priests, went out and saw him hewing stones. They filled the quarry before him with gold dinars. From where is it derived that his brethren elevate him if he does not have? As it is stated: “The priest who is greater than his brethren [<i>me’eḥav</i>].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This can be interpreted to mean that he becomes great through  his brethren [me’eḥav].</i>  <br>Not only the High Priest, but the king is similar. Likewise, you find regarding King David, when he went to battle with Goliath, Saul said to him: “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth” (I Samuel 17:33). David said to him: “Your servant was a shepherd for his father among the sheep, and the lion or the bear would come and carry off a lamb from the flock. I would go out after it, smite it, and save it from its mouth. It rose against me, but I grabbed its beard, smote it, and killed it. Both the lion and the bear, your servant smote, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them” (I Samuel 17:34–36). <br>Saul said to him: ‘Who said to you that you are able to kill him?’ Immediately, David answered him: “The Lord who delivered me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine” (I Samuel 17:37). Immediately, “Saul dressed David in his garments” (I Samuel 17:38). It is written regarding Saul: “From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people” (I Samuel 9:2). When he dressed him in his garments and saw that they were appropriate for him, he immediately cast an evil eye on him. When David saw that Saul was humiliated, he said to him: “I will be unable to walk with these, as I am inexperienced. David removed them from upon him” (I Samuel 17:39). You learn that even if a person is short, and becomes king, he becomes taller. Why to that extent? It is because when one is anointed with the anointing oil, he becomes the most outstanding of all his brethren. David said: ‘I rejoice in the anointing oil with which I was anointed,’ as it is stated: “Therefore, my heart rejoices, my being exults; my flesh, too, rests securely” (Psalms 16:9).", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "657ecc69758c1dc532ec910d", "index_title": "Steinsaltz on Numbers", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Steinsaltz on Numbers 8:18", "anchorRef": "Numbers 8:18", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 8:18"], "sourceRef": "Steinsaltz on Numbers 8:18", "sourceHeRef": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על במדבר ח׳:י״ח", "anchorVerse": 18, "sourceHasEn": true, "commentaryNum": 8.0018, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Steinsaltz", "he": "ביאור שטיינזלץ"}, "heTitle": "ביאור שטיינזלץ על במדבר", "he": "ואחר כך – \n  <b>וָאֶקַּח אֶת הַלְוִיִּם תַּחַת כָּל בְּכוֹר בִּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.</b> הלויים נעשו תחליף לבכורות.\n  ", "heVersionTitle": "The Koren Steinsaltz Tanakh HaMevoar - Hebrew", "heLicense": "Copyright: Steinsaltz Center", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "<b>I have </b>then <b>taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the children of Israel. </b>", "versionTitle": "The Steinsaltz Tanakh - English", "license": "Copyright: Steinsaltz Center", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "52569e15edbab4498f484000", "index_title": "Ibn Ezra on Numbers", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Ibn Ezra on Numbers 8:18:1", "anchorRef": "Numbers 8:18", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 8:18"], "sourceRef": "Ibn Ezra on Numbers 8:18:1", "sourceHeRef": "אבן עזרא על במדבר ח׳:י״ח:א׳", "anchorVerse": 18, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1155, 1165], "commentaryNum": 18.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Ibn Ezra", "he": "אבן עזרא"}, "heTitle": "אבן עזרא על במדבר", "he": "וטעם <b>ואקח את הלוים.</b> וכבר אמר לקחתי אותם לי כי כן דרך המקרא והוא דבק עם הפסוק הבא אחריו וכאשר לקחתי לי הלוים נתתים אני לאהרן ולבניו:", "heVersionTitle": "On Your Way", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "ובלכתך בדרך", "text": "[AND I HAVE TAKEN THE LEVITES.] Scripture has already stated, <i>have I taken them unto Me</i> (v. 16).
