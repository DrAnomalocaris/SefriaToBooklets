Greenstein 1985a). Once the book of Exodus ends, with the erection of the Tabernacle—a symbolic reflection of the cosmos in which God “takes up dwelling” among the Israelites—we are left with a structure that must be carefully guarded and its ritual purity maintained. To this end, Leviticus now turns to the issue of pollutants, largely of the body, that arise from what we might call territorial problems: the border of what goes into the body, expressed through animals permitted and forbidden for food; the border between life and death, as expressed through sexual functions and discharges; and the border of outer surfaces, as expressed through skin disease (<i>tzaraat</i>), mildew on clothing, and mold on houses. The system of avoidance and purification that is presented in Chapters 11–15 ensures that the “Holy-Area” will either not become polluted or, should that prove to be unavoidable, will be properly decontaminated, for such contamination has the potential of leading to God’s withdrawal from dwelling “in the midst” of the people of Israel.", "The pollutants discussed in these chapters do not by and large carry with them punishments per se; that is, they are not regarded as violations of the moral order (although <i>tzaraat</i> in biblical stories often did carry the implication that the victim had in fact done something to deserve his or her condition). Nor do they pose an actual danger to the person—unless he or she comes in contact with holy objects, people, or space. Then it becomes clear that biblical pollution was considered contagious; hence the need for rituals. What was generally required was that the polluted person observe a period of separation from the sanctuary (or, in more extreme cases, from the camp), to be reintegrated after either time alone or with the addition of laundering their clothes and/or washing themselves. In the latter cases, water was seen as acting as a purifying agent, not as cleanser in the detergent sense (and so the word “unclean,” so often used in translating Heb. <i>tamei</i>, is misleading). As before, these processes applied to priests (cf. Chap. 22) and to laypeople alike (Chaps. 12–15). The major pollutant, death, was seen as so virulent that it received treatment in a separate setting, Num. 19.", "A different category of pollution existed alongside the one we have just mentioned. It included human wrongdoing, which we might call immoral or unjust actions (e.g., incest, oppression of the poor), and also transgression of boundaries (e.g., between holy and profane, or breaching the fairly rigid system of classification in nature among animals, textiles, etc.). These types of pollution, then, involved behavior which can be seen to be disruptive or worse to the established social order. As a rule they could not be atoned for through sacrifice or other ritual forms, but lead to exile or death. They are dealt with mainly in the final section of Leviticus, Chapters 18–26.", "For a full discussion of the issue of pollution in biblical Israel, see Frymer-Kensky (1983) and Greenstein (1984a).", "O<small>N</small> T<small>HE</small> D<small>IETARY</small> R<small>ULES</small>", "T<small>HE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS INTERPRETATIONS OVER THE AGES</small>, <small>THE SYSTEM OF DI</small>etary laws laid down in Lev. 11 is best understood in the broader context of both the structure of the book and of the Levitical worldview. For the former, see the commentary to Chapter 11; for the latter, the following may be helpful.", "It has long been recognized that seeing the dietary laws as resulting from consciousness of hygiene is a deeply inadequate way of understanding them. Nor can some of the later explanations adduced by Jewish tradition, however noble (for instance, that adhering to such a system teaches self-discipline), provide a satisfactory explanation for the rules in the context of Leviticus. What is more to the point is that the priestly worldview stressed boundaries and order. A hierarchy reigns in virtually every aspect of Israelite life as conceived in the Torah: people, land, animals, eligibility for the priesthood, the Tabernacle, and the calendar. There is a complex system of “graded holiness” (Jenson) informing Israelite life, with two basic messages: (1) God is to be approached in stages, and (2) the world is set up in a tight, ordered structure which reflects the distinctions between God and humans, Israel and the other peoples.", "It is especially the latter that is at work in the dietary laws. The animals are discussed in categories that are reminiscent of the (priestly) creation story of Genesis 1; note the refrain in both passages of (each animal) “according to its kind.” Lev. 11 makes distinctions, and scholars have sought to understand them according to a number of possible criteria: ease/clarity of classification (anomalies, especially as regards locomotion, tend to be prohibited), whether or not the animal is carnivorous (those that are, are prohibited), and the wild or domestic status of the animal (the former are frequently prohibited). The message that emerges from the scheme is multifaceted. It would appear to hold that:", "1. Human activity is to reflect the inherent orderliness of creation, a kind of imitation of God (namely, as he kept things clear at the beginning, you should do the same with what enters your body).", "2. The ideal state, already portrayed in the Garden of Eden story, is vegetarianism—where no animal life need be taken by humans (this despite God’s command to Adam to “dominate [the earth]” in Gen. 1:28).", "3. Animals permitted for consumption, among them those fit for sacrifice, are by and large those which are familiar to the Israelites in daily life through domestication. They tend to be animals often used by the Bible to symbolize humans. Eilberg-Schwartz calls this phenomenon “Israel in the mirror of nature,” and gives numerous examples extending throughout Israelite culture. He concludes that “the dietary restrictions carve up the animal world along the same lines as Israelite thought … [they] specify what kinds of animals are ‘food for thought.’”", "It should be mentioned that Mary Douglas, who pioneered an anthropological approach to these laws three decades ago, has recently given them another go (1993b). In earlier studies, Douglas (1966) saw the system in Lev. 11 as we have indicated above—as a “cognitive ordering of the universe”; she also spoke of it as symbolizing the protection of boundaries in Israelite society. Her latest understanding focuses on the animals as reflective of the idea that (Israelite) culture is aimed at demonstrating God’s righteousness/justice in all areas of life, through laws regarding the body. Thus, priests, sacrificial animals, and food animals may not have any “blemish” (below, “defect”) in them; and animals prohibited for eating are either the perpetrators or victims of predation (symbolizing the human perpetrators or victims of injustice).", "A final point relates to a major theme in Leviticus and indeed in many of the priestly texts of the Torah: separateness. We have seen how a major function in God’s creation of the world—with which the Bible opens!—is “separating” aspects of the natural world. A parallel verb was used in the plague narratives of Exodus, “making a distinction” (between Israelites and Egyptians). With the dietary regulations, “separating” returns. Given these thematics, one can say that Chapter 11 is a linchpin of priestly thinking. Like sexual relations, the other area of intimacy in human affairs, eating in the Bible goes far beyond the confines of one’s home and comes to symbolize an entire approach to life.", "O<small>N</small> T<small>HE</small> R<small>ITUAL</small> P<small>OLLUTION</small> O<small>F</small> T<small>HE</small> B<small>ODY</small>", "O<small>F SPECIAL CONCERN TO THE COMPILERS OF LEVITICUS WAS RITUAL POLLUTION ARIS</small>ing from certain physical conditions. To many people, this section is even less interesting than the opening chapters of the book, and seems impossibly bogged down in primitive conceptions of disease and hygiene. But despite the fact that they undoubtedly reflect some ancient conceptions in these areas, these conditions and the role of the priest in making rulings on them have less to do with hygiene and medicine than they do with maintaining the borders between life and death, and symbolically affirming life.", "It seems that the polluting discharges are primarily sexual in nature, and this is probably not accidental. The biblical priests, in their extreme concern with both procreation/genealogy (especially of men, since the priesthood was male-hereditary) and purity (in approaching the sanctuary), were presented with a major problem. God, who was to be served in purity, was also the One in whose image human beings were made (Gen. 1:26), yet as a being beyond sexuality, who had neither relationships with other deities nor even a body. He left it ambiguous as to just how humans were to work out their sexual relations. The answer to the dilemma is at least partly solved by the Torah’s regulations regarding pollution and purity, incest and marriage. It is here that the issue of control is most significant. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that control and boundaries apply not only to Israel and the nations, but also and especially to male and female. As a male hierarchy, the priests viewed women, with their closer connections to the life process (and maybe also to previous forms of paganism in the form of goddess worship), as potentially dangerous, or at least problematic, to their system of purity. The seeming “disorder” of women’s discharges (perhaps representing “nature”) threatened the imposition of order (“culture”) that is so central to priestly thinking. But as a group concerned with the perpetuation of both the priestly class and the people of Israel, the priestly class could not do without women altogether, and the inescapable conclusion was strict regulation (cf. also Wegner 1992). Such regulation—labeling certain states or acts “polluting”—had the added benefit of controlling private morality in a way that could not be done otherwise (Douglas 1966).", "It is important to note that in classical Judaism after the year 70 (the date of the destruction of the Second Temple), the “purity” laws, while still assiduously studied, by and large ceased to operate except within the sphere of marriage. Thus, to this day, religious Jewish couples temporarily separate sexually during the wife’s period, but this by itself does not legally affect her participation in traditional ritual. The disease here termed <i>tzaraat</i>, translated for millennia as “leprosy,” is now recognized to be something different, perhaps several forms of skin disease involving scaling or flaking. These have nowhere near the frightening and fatal implications of classic leprosy (Hansen’s Disease). Leviticus nevertheless treats <i>tzaraat</i> at great length and in close detail. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the book, it is clear that at least parts of Leviticus were originally intended as manuals for priestly “instruction” (note, by the way, the sevenfold occurrence of the term in the pollution chapters, 11–15). It has been theorized that <i>tzaraat</i> is of such concern here because it was felt to resemble death/decay in a clear, outward fashion, and hence fits into these chapters, which deal so much with boundaries.", "An unexpected addition, from a contemporary point of view, to the <i>tzaraat</i> of the body is that which appears on textiles and on house walls (a fungus or mold or “dry rot”). The fact that the same word is used to apply to all these situations indicates that a wide concept is being applied here: how visible imperfection damages the utopia of the sacred society.", "Finally, the role of the priest in these chapters should be noted. He does not function to remove demons or perform magical rites, but rather to examine the one suspected of having the disease (note the repetition of “look” in the chapter). He is more teacher and guardian of purity than healer or intermediary."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

Many people find it difficult to relate to the description of ritual slaughter of animals and the disposal of their blood and flesh in the opening section of the book, or to the detailed prescriptions regarding bodily functions, skin disease, and mold in Chapters 12–15. Others experience Leviticus as obscure: Why exactly do Aaron’s sons die in Chapter 10? How can one explain the ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter 16? A frequently encountered reaction to the book is the desire to get on to the book of Numbers—which at least has some intriguing narratives such as Moses’ sin and punishment, the faint-heartedness of the spies, and Balaam’s reversed prophecies.", "Yet Leviticus, as it has been placed in the Torah, signals that something of singular importance is at work. The book, after all, occurs at the center of the overall five-book structure. Unlike the other four, it is set entirely around Mount Sinai, and so it forms, geographically as well as structurally, the heart of the Torah document. In addition, the priestly interests so clearly presented in Leviticus appear throughout the Torah: as genealogical lists (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers), descriptions of rituals (Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and details about the building of the desert “Dwelling” of God (Exodus). Indeed, the opening chapter of it all, Gen. 1 (the Creation story), has strong links in both its themes and terminology with the priestly law.", "Leviticus in fact presents a significant strain, conventionally termed the “priestly” view, in biblical thought. Anthropologically considered, it sheds important light on the outlook of some of those who compiled and read the Hebrew Bible. And the process did not stop there. Many of the categories found in Leviticus were continued and expanded by later Judaism: regulations concerning sexuality and diet, concepts of separation and holiness, and how to deal with one’s fellow human beings in a variety of economic and social settings. These found expression in different but still recognizable form simultaneously in the development of Christianity.", "In late antiquity Leviticus was known as <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, the Priestly Instruction (or simultaneously understood, as Levine suggests, as the Instruction of the Priests). Given both the concerns of the priestly writers and the wording they use to express those concerns, I see Leviticus as the Book of Separations, the book in which are set forth distinctions between a whole range of aspects of ancient Israelite experience and practice: holy and profane; ritual purity and pollution; permitted and forbidden in sexuality and diet; Israelites and others; and priests, Levites, and common folk among the Israelites. This near-obsession with drawing lines (or, as Douglas has presented it, concentric circles) may in some sense reflect the position of Israel in the ancient Near East as a small, beleaguered newcomer in a region of hoary empires, situated on land that was constantly invaded by both great powers and local foes. It may also be an echo of the larger Bronze Age and Iron Age process of change from the former, well-nigh universal worship of the Mother Goddess, to the later patriarchal societies with which the Western world still deals through its three monotheistic religions and their cultural outgrowths.", "Overarching the theme of separations or distinctions, through much of the book, is the polarity of order/disorder, represented best in Leviticus by the problem of life and death. As many scholars have noted, regulations regarding sacrifice here connect up with symbolically offering up human life—through the substitution of an animal—to the deity; blood is avoided at all costs, due to its connoting life. Animals that may be used for food (as well as for sacrifice) are in the main those which do not consume other living creatures. Pollutants which endanger the purity of the sanctuary (“Dwelling”) include bodily emissions which the Israelites connected with death (e.g., menstrual blood and “wasted” semen). Finally, the complex system of purification from some kind of skin disease may well originate in the similarity between disease and death. In sum, then, it is no surprise that, two books later, the Deuteronomic Moses implores the people to “choose life” rather than the “death” engendered by improper behavior by both priests and commoners.", "Interestingly, the strong urge to make order (ritual laws) out of disorder (the chaotic processes of human life, from killing animals for food to sexual relations) is reflected in other aspects of the Torah—most notably in the narrative portrayal of the descent lines from father Abraham. Here, the discontinuity represented by sibling rivalries and other threats to survival is countered by God’s establishing a kind of continuity through the choosing of younger brothers. In this case, the strong hand of ritual control is replaced by the somewhat hazardous element of surprise and close calls. But it does manage to provide for family continuity and, ultimately, the survival of the people. Whether this points to early or later experiences historically is the subject of ongoing and unresolved debate among biblical scholars. A widely accepted possibility is that the Torah as we have it was edited by priestly editors living in or shortly after the Babylonian Exile (6th–5th centuries <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.), and that those editors took earlier material (which itself was already multilayered) and adapted it into an overall scheme expressing promise, disobedience, destruction, and survival/hope (cf. Fox 1993).", "In point of fact, Leviticus is best viewed as only a part, albeit the major one as a bloc, of a major thrust of the Torah. According to most biblical scholars, the “priestly” worldview, and the texts that may be attributed to it, makes its appearance with the very chapter with which the entire Torah begins, Gen. 1. Here distinctions and ordering are at the very heart of the text. God, immediately after his first creation-by-word (light), “separates” between light and darkness, then goes on to perform the same operation between heavenly waters (the storehouses of rain) and earthly ones. His remaining acts of creation involve putting heavenly bodies, vegetation, and animal life in order—each “according to its kind,” on specific days of creation. Animals are distinguished from plants through their receiving vocal divine blessing; humans from animals through the addition to the blessing of the phrase “have dominion over” the rest of living things. At the same time, humans are told that they may eat only what grows from the ground, implying that to do otherwise would be a violation of the order of things. Crowning the whole account is the poem (Gen. 2:1–4a) about God’s “finishing” of the “work” of creation, symbolized by his “hallowing” (making holy or separate-for-God) the seventh day. In Gen. 1, then, we are presented with a brief but complete vision of the cosmos as ordered in space, time, and life-forms, under the aegis of a metasexual, nonviolent, and benevolent deity.", "As Genesis unfolds under priestly influence, humans are presented with basic rules and warned of the consequences if those rules are broken. The paradisical situation of Adam and Eve (no labor, vegetarianism, no danger from animals, and sexual innocence) is disrupted by human disobedience, resulting in banishment from Eden—a shattering of the previous wholeness and order. Cain’s murder of his brother leads to the same punishment: uprootedness and hard labor. The mixing of divine and human beings in Gen. 6:1–2 results in a clear distinction being established by God, that humans will henceforth be limited in age. Finally, the account of the universal flood in Chapters 6–9 presents a picture that uses a number of Leviticus motifs. The earth is to be destroyed because human wrongdoing has “ruined” it (or, in Levitical language, “polluted” it). Animal life is rescued by means of taking pairs of animals aboard the ark—with Leviticus’s distinctions of “pure” and impure dutifully mentioned. Noah’s three sons, who also come onto the ark, later become the forefathers of three great divisions of humanity, as laid out in detail in the genealogical lists of Chapters 10–11. Finally, the new beginning of the cosmos, with Noah as a second Adam (cf. the latter’s blessing in 1:28 with that of the former in 9:1–2), is accompanied by both animal sacrifices and dietary restrictions (the introduction of meat is new, accompanied by the caveat—as in Lev. 17—that blood is not to be consumed).", "A major part of the priestly scheme emerges with the detailed instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (God’s place of “Dwelling” on earth) and the priestly vestments that are to be worn there, in Ex. 25–31 (with much of this material repeated in narrative form in Chapters 35–40). The details make sense as part of a larger picture, in which the closer one gets to the “Holiest Holy-Shrine” where God takes up dwelling, the more central the measurements of space and the more precious the materials used. This concentric sense of order is reflected also in the layout of the wilderness camp of the Israelites in Num. 2. Thus the Tabernacle functions as a minicosmos, a visible and ritual representation of the creation itself. Through the layout of curtains within and tribal encampments without, space is ordered; through the festivals (enumerated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with some mention in Exodus as well), time is ordered. And, thanks to the provisions laid out in Leviticus, through priest/lay hierarchy, dietary rules, and sacrificial regulations, life-forms are ordered. The result is an almost utopian scheme. It is a world in which everything and everyone are to take their place under the perfect worship of a perfect God, banishing or avoiding death, defect, and disorder. In the priestly view, the world is to be an echo of the divine order that is portrayed in the Creation story.", "Viewed in the perspective of priestly concerns (only part of which we have just outlined), Leviticus is largely concerned with the potential disruption of this utopia. If Genesis chronicles threats to the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham, if Numbers recounts threats to his descendants’ survival on their march through the wilderness, then Leviticus concentrates on threats to Israel’s life with God. It presents a whole system of rules designed, first, to provide for purification and reconciliation with God through the sacrificial cult; second, to protect sanctuary, priests, land, and people from estrangement from God (via “pollution” of various kinds); and, finally, to establish a code of behavior that will ensure the perpetual enjoyment of God’s blessings on the land promised to Israel’s ancestors. From this it can readily be seen how Leviticus, far from being of interest to specialists and historians only, is in fact a crucial part of the Torah—perhaps its most crucial part, in that it supplies the ideological center of gravity for the whole. Once Leviticus is added to the narratives, poems, laws, and lists that comprise the rest of the Torah, a picture emerges that is more than literature and more than history. The five books become the multilayered and multifaceted monument that has been studied, puzzled over, and built upon for over two millennia.", "In sum, the world of the priestly strain in the Torah is a realm of desired order and perfection, a realm in which wholeness is to reign, in which anomaly and undesired mixture are not permitted, and in which boundaries are zealously guarded. The human body becomes symbolic of the cosmos: its life/death boundary is marked, and troublesome flows from it are carefully regulated. The land of Israel becomes symbolic of the cosmos: too much evildoing pollutes it, to the point where it can do naught else but “vomit out” its settlers (as it vomited out the previous ones). The animal kingdom, from which humans are allowed to take life under carefully prescribed circumstances, becomes symbolic of cosmic values, through heightening awareness of predator and victim, and careful avoidance of blood, the symbol of life. Indeed, in the system of Leviticus, it is no wonder that death is the major pollutant, and that blood of acceptable animal sacrifice is the agent through which human beings find atonement for minor pollutants.", "The book as it is presently laid out falls into three major sections, with a number of chapters that function either as connectors or appendices to various sections. Linkages and connecting theme words will be spelled out in more detail in the commentary; for the moment, the following outline may suffice:", "I The Sacrificial Cult", "1–7 Sacrificial Offerings: Their Ritual and Disposal", "8–9 The Installation of the Priests", "10 Systems Failure", "II Ritual Pollution and Purification", "11 Forbidden and Permitted Foods: Transition", "12–15 Pollution from Bodily Fluids and Skin Disease", "16 Purifying the Sanctuary and the High Priest", "Appendix: 17 On the Shedding of Animal Blood", "III Holiness", "18 Pollution from Forbidden Unions: Transition", "19:3–4 Frame at Beginning", "19–20 Holiness in Public/Private Behavior", "21–22 Holiness in Priestly Behavior", "23 Holiness in the Calendar", "24 Miscellaneous", "25 Regulations Concerning Land and Slaves", "26:1–2 Frame at End", "26:3–46 Holiness Confirmed or Denied: The Blessing and the Curse", "Appendix: 27 Assessments for the Priests", "Other commentators have of course seen it differently. Most follow the traditional scholarly approach of starting the “Holiness Code” with Chapter 17; Levine rightly parallels it to the beginnings of other law collections in the Torah (Ex. 20:19–23 and Deut. 12; the ending here in Chapter 26 also parallels the endings in the other two codes). Hallo understands the structure as 1–11: Rites of Consumption; 12–16: Rites of Purification; and 17–26: Holiness.", "Overshadowing the clear three-part structure, however one wants to divide it up, is the complex issue of two apparent documents or schools of thought. Biblical scholarship terms these P (“Priestly”) and H (“Holiness”), and roughly attributes the first part of the book (through Chap. 16) to P, with the rest to H. There has been detailed, ongoing debate about the approaches and dating of these sources. As of this writing, it is generally accepted that H is later than P, but there seem to be numerous interpolations of one source into the other, and it is difficult to place them historically with certainty. Here, as elsewhere in biblical literature, we have a layering effect rather than a clear-cut delineation of “authors.” As usual, that appears to have been intentional.", "A word should be said about the relationship between law and narrative in the Torah. As Damrosch has noted, the legal and cultic texts in the five books might be seen by modern readers as intrusive. On the surface, they certainly seem to interrupt a good story. Genesis is largely unencumbered by nonaction (except for the genealogical lists—attributed to P!), but the gripping account of the redemption from Egypt in Exodus, and the drama of revelation on and apostasy beneath Mount Sinai, give way to the sober architectural details of the Tabernacle’s construction. Similarly, the narratives of the book of Numbers, which are among the most striking in the literature, are set off against a background of censuses, laws about suspected adultery and the taking of vows, Levitical duties in the Dwelling, and an enumeration of sacrificial gifts brought by the tribes, among other things.", "The bulk of material in Leviticus, and its placement in the Torah, make it clear that the five books that we have convey their point precisely through the medium of narrative <i>plus</i> cult/law. In the Israelite worldview, these two rather distinct forms, which intermingle past, present, and future (Damrosch), fruitfully enrich and explain one another. It is as if a history of the American Revolution contained all of the debates on and drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as accounts of battles and biographies of key personalities. That such an approach parallels neither Homeric epic nor ritual texts in their purity of form is exactly the point: we have here a new genre of great complexity and richness, in which narratives exemplify laws and laws follow narratives. The result is truly a torah, a “teaching” or “instruction.”", "Finally, we might mention the issue of priests and laypeople. Scholars have often seen Leviticus as originating as a manual for priests. What is most fascinating, and perhaps most important (for later history), about this book is the way in which it takes priestly rules and transmutes at least some of them for use in the general populace of ancient Israel. This can be seen most dramatically in the dietary laws, which in other cultures often serve exclusively for priests, and in the area of sexual taboos, which do likewise. In postbiblical Judaism this shift becomes particularly evident: the Jew’s dinner table is termed a “sanctuary in miniature” (complete with loaves of bread and the use of salt—two elements found in the ancient sacrificial cult); dietary laws are expanded for the general population to provide for separation of milk and meat; and separation of husband and wife during menstruation, among traditional Jews, leaves the context of Sanctuary pollution and finds a home in the context of a philosophy of marriage. Many other examples could be brought of the widening of priestly laws to an entire people. Perhaps most dramatic—and most significant—is the eventual shift of the learning and interpretation of sacred texts away from the priests, who in most cultures served as the guardians of the text (and often the culture’s only literate body; cf. medieval Christian Europe). In Judaism of late antiquity, this monopoly was decisively broken; first the scribe and then the rabbi (“master”) took over, with learning extended at last to all those who might make the effort to acquire it. The great exception, at least in antiquity, was women—who, it will be noted, were also excluded from priestly functions in the Bible.", "Three relatively recent developments make it possible to approach Leviticus as a significant, powerful, and interesting biblical text. The first is the explosion of both full-length and shorter studies of the book and its concerns that have appeared in recent years. The work of Milgrom (1991), Levine (1989), Wenham (1979), Eilberg-Schwartz (1990), and Bamberger (1981), to cite just a few of the English-language studies on aspects of Leviticus, now makes it possible to have a serious entry into the book based largely on advances in understanding the cultures of the ancient Near East. It also, admittedly, puts the translator and commentator in a bind: is it possible to add anything new, or will it suffice simply to summarize? My approach in this volume has been largely the latter, along with suggesting to the reader some fruitful directions for further study.", "The second development helpful for approaching Leviticus, which also informs many of the studies just mentioned, is the using of anthropological insights to understand concepts and rituals found in the book. Such an approach places Leviticus in a broader human context, indicating what it does and does not share with other cultural and religious systems. For Leviticus is concerned with the same issues that plague all human societies: how to deal with the boundaries of life and death, how to comprehend and approach the transcendent in life, how to understand one’s (or one’s nation’s) place in the cosmic order, how to make for a just society. Viewed in this light, the book is a “Small Code” (cf. Northrop Frye’s designation of the Bible as “the Great Code”). That is, Leviticus need not remain a total mystery to us, to be unraveled only through detailed analysis and even change (Judaism) or substitution (Christianity), but can be understood on its own terms, if approached with care and in the spirit of seeking the larger picture in the details.", "Finally, we should mention the aesthetic dimension. Like the other books of the Torah, Leviticus uses its own rhetoric to convey its message. Far from employing flat “priestly” style (whatever that may be), it uses formulas, refrains, and other rhythmical forms to impress its teaching (Heb. <i>tora</i>) upon its hearers. This aspect of the book has been the subject of recent study (cf. Paran), but was already echoed in the Buber-Rosenzweig translation. It is my hope that the present volume will contribute to an appreciation of the style of Leviticus."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.
