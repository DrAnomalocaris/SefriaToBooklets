## Genesis 44

|וַיִּגַּ֨שׁ אֵלָ֜יו יְהוּדָ֗ה וַיֹּ֘אמֶר֮ בִּ֣י אֲדֹנִי֒ יְדַבֶּר־נָ֨א עַבְדְּךָ֤ דָבָר֙ בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י אֲדֹנִ֔י וְאַל־יִ֥חַר אַפְּךָ֖ בְּעַבְדֶּ֑ךָ כִּ֥י כָמ֖וֹךָ כְּפַרְעֹֽה׃|18 J|Then Judah went up to him and said, “Please, my lord, let your servant appeal to my lord, and do not be impatient with your servant, you who are the equal of Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the power of prayer in overturning divine decrees, as seen in Yehudah's plea to Joseph to save Benjamin. The interaction symbolizes a spiritual confrontation between the Jewish collective soul and an individual ruler, highlighting the role of tzaddikim in interceding for others. The text explores the divine essence within creation and the importance of recognizing God's presence in all situations. Yehudah's strategic approach to Joseph combines legal arguments, pleas for mercy, and a willingness to resort to war if necessary. The Midrash portrays Judah's fight for justice against Joseph's unjust treatment of Benjamin, demonstrating humility and loyalty within the covenant of brotherhood. Targum highlights Yehudah's private plea to Joseph, emphasizing the protection of Benjamin and their status as kings in Canaan. Radak, Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, Simchat HaRegel, and Tze'enah Ure'enah provide various interpretations of the text, connecting it to themes of righteousness, loyalty, and the future of Israel. 

|אֲדֹנִ֣י שָׁאַ֔ל אֶת־עֲבָדָ֖יו לֵאמֹ֑ר הֲיֵשׁ־לָכֶ֥ם אָ֖ב אוֹ־אָֽח׃|19 J|My lord asked his servants, ‘Have you a father or another brother?’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehuda attributes the theft accusation against Binyamin to God's will, emphasizing that one is not punished for a deficiency until it is brought into action, showing actions are only punished when one's own will is involved. Judah appeals for compassion to Joseph, offering himself as a servant in Benjamin's place, accusing Joseph of using subterfuge. Judah's concern for Benjamin and willingness to sacrifice himself is highlighted in the Midrash, leading to a more gentle exchange with Joseph. Ramban and Rashi offer interpretations of the brothers' altered message to Jacob and Joseph's questions about their family, while the Targums provide translations and interpretations of Joseph's interactions with his brothers. 

|וַנֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֔י יֶשׁ־לָ֙נוּ֙ אָ֣ב זָקֵ֔ן וְיֶ֥לֶד זְקֻנִ֖ים קָטָ֑ן וְאָחִ֣יו מֵ֔ת וַיִּוָּתֵ֨ר ה֧וּא לְבַדּ֛וֹ לְאִמּ֖וֹ וְאָבִ֥יו אֲהֵבֽוֹ׃|20 J|We told my lord, ‘We have an old father, and there is a child of his old age, the youngest; his full brother is dead, so that he alone is left of his mother, and his father dotes on him.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers of Joseph mentioned their father's old age to indicate Joseph could have been young, with Judah lying about Joseph's death out of fear he would ask for Benjamin to be brought to Egypt. Joseph was the only surviving son of his mother. Ramban explains that Joseph was called the son of Jacob's old age because he was born when Jacob was old and wise, with Tze'enah Ure'enah discussing Judah's fear of Joseph asking for Benjamin back, leading to the death of both Benjamin and Jacob. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the message that Joseph's brothers told him they have an old father, a young son of his old age whose brother is dead, and he is the only one left of his mother, and their father loves him. 

|וַתֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־עֲבָדֶ֔יךָ הוֹרִדֻ֖הוּ אֵלָ֑י וְאָשִׂ֥ימָה עֵינִ֖י עָלָֽיו׃|21 J|Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set eyes on him.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret Judah's plea to bring Benjamin to Egypt as a promise to guard and treat him well, with Joseph's request to see Benjamin personally seen as a promise of protection from harm. Divine providence manifests differently based on merit, as seen in examples like the preservation of the four kings of Sodom for Lot's sake. Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis interpret Judah's approach to Joseph differently, with Judah ultimately trying to calm the situation by speaking gently to Joseph. Rashi criticizes Judah for being unreliable in issuing decrees and not fulfilling them, warning that he may be stricken with leprosy like Pharaoh for detaining Benjamin. Targum translations of "that I may set my eyes on him" emphasize divine favor and grace towards Benjamin. 

|וַנֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֔י לֹא־יוּכַ֥ל הַנַּ֖עַר לַעֲזֹ֣ב אֶת־אָבִ֑יו וְעָזַ֥ב אֶת־אָבִ֖יו וָמֵֽת׃|22 J|We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he were to leave him, his father would die.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, Rashi, and Steinsaltz all explain that if Benjamin were to leave his father, his father would die. In the Musar commentary, it is emphasized that standing up against evil is important, even if it means risking one's life. Rashi discusses King Shlomo's age when he became king, and explains that Judah's brothers revealed the truth out of fear of losing another brother. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both translate the statement about Benjamin not leaving his father as indicating that he would die if he did so. 

|וַתֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־עֲבָדֶ֔יךָ אִם־לֹ֥א יֵרֵ֛ד אֲחִיכֶ֥ם הַקָּטֹ֖ן אִתְּכֶ֑ם לֹ֥א תֹסִפ֖וּן לִרְא֥וֹת פָּנָֽי׃|23 J|But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, do not let me see your faces.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno suggests Joseph brought Benjamin as punishment, Steinsaltz notes Joseph's requirement to see Benjamin. Midrash emphasizes brotherhood and loyalty among Jacob's sons. Rashi interprets Numbers 24:8 as dividing land or wounding enemies. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate Genesis 44:23 as Joseph warning his brothers they won't see his face without Benjamin. 

|וַיְהִי֙ כִּ֣י עָלִ֔ינוּ אֶֽל־עַבְדְּךָ֖ אָבִ֑י וַנַּ֨גֶּד־ל֔וֹ אֵ֖ת דִּבְרֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽי׃|24 J|When we came back to your servant my father, we reported my lord’s words to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah told Joseph that their father initially refused to let Benjamin go with them, but eventually agreed due to the famine. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi suggests Joseph died before his brothers because he embalmed his father against God's will, while the Rabbis argue Jacob commanded it. Rav Yehuda explains Joseph was called "Bones" for his humility in not protesting when his brothers referred to Jacob as his servant. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the brothers telling their father about their master's words. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אָבִ֑ינוּ שֻׁ֖בוּ שִׁבְרוּ־לָ֥נוּ מְעַט־אֹֽכֶל׃|25 J|“Later our father said, ‘Go back and procure some food for us.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers forced their father to send Benjamin due to the severity of the famine, with Jacob warning them that not bringing Benjamin back would cause him deep sorrow (Sforno on Genesis 44:25:1). Midrash Tanchuma Buber emphasizes the need to subdue the land before the children of Israel when going down to Egypt to buy food. Onkelos translates "food" as "grain," while Targum Jonathan translates it as "corn" in Genesis 44:25. 

|וַנֹּ֕אמֶר לֹ֥א נוּכַ֖ל לָרֶ֑דֶת אִם־יֵשׁ֩ אָחִ֨ינוּ הַקָּטֹ֤ן אִתָּ֙נוּ֙ וְיָרַ֔דְנוּ כִּי־לֹ֣א נוּכַ֗ל לִרְאוֹת֙ פְּנֵ֣י הָאִ֔ישׁ וְאָחִ֥ינוּ הַקָּטֹ֖ן אֵינֶ֥נּוּ אִתָּֽנוּ׃|26 J|We answered, ‘We cannot go down; only if our youngest brother is with us can we go down, for we may not show our faces to the man  unless our youngest brother is with us.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The literal translation of Genesis 44:1 is "see the man's face." According to Steinsaltz, the brothers cannot go to Egypt without their youngest brother. R. Nehemiah explains that Judah was sent ahead to establish an academy for Joseph to teach Torah. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of the youngest brother being present to see the man's face. 

|וַיֹּ֛אמֶר עַבְדְּךָ֥ אָבִ֖י אֵלֵ֑ינוּ אַתֶּ֣ם יְדַעְתֶּ֔ם כִּ֥י שְׁנַ֖יִם יָֽלְדָה־לִּ֥י אִשְׁתִּֽי׃|27 J|Your servant my father said to us, ‘As you know, my wife bore me two sons.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob emphasized the special status of Benjamin as the only remaining son from his beloved wife Rachel, justifying Judah's concern for Benjamin's safety. Joseph was called "bones while yet alive" for not protesting when his father's honor was disparaged by his brothers, dying before them due to arrogance. Judah showed effective leadership by acknowledging his flaws, protecting his kin, and committing to his family, while Benjamin was innocent and Judah took responsibility for his welfare. Targum mentions Jacob telling his sons that his wife Rachel bore him two sons. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֤א הָֽאֶחָד֙ מֵֽאִתִּ֔י וָאֹמַ֕ר אַ֖ךְ טָרֹ֣ף טֹרָ֑ף וְלֹ֥א רְאִיתִ֖יו עַד־הֵֽנָּה׃|28 J|But one is gone from me, and I said: Alas, he was torn by a beast! And I have not seen him since.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah suggests Jacob believed Joseph was torn apart by wild animals but still alive, emphasizing the importance of spiritual values over material wealth. The Mishnah discusses errors in prayer and Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa's practice of predicting prayer outcomes. Ramban and Bartenura provide interpretations of specific words in Leviticus 23:27 and Mishnah Berakhot 5:5:2, respectively. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate Jacob's belief that one of his sons is dead in Genesis 44:28. 

|וּלְקַחְתֶּ֧ם גַּם־אֶת־זֶ֛ה מֵעִ֥ם פָּנַ֖י וְקָרָ֣הוּ אָס֑וֹן וְהֽוֹרַדְתֶּ֧ם אֶת־שֵׂיבָתִ֛י בְּרָעָ֖ה שְׁאֹֽלָה׃|29 J|If you take this one from me, too, and he meets with disaster, you will send my white head down to Sheol in sorrow.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that "ason" refers to accidental death, Siftei Chakhamim clarifies that Yaakov would be more sorrowful for Binyomin than for Rochel, Yoseif, or Shimon, Rashi notes that if Benjamin were lost, it would be as if all three had died the same day, Steinsaltz adds that Yaakov's old age would be even worse if Benjamin were taken away, Tze'enah Ure'enah points out that Benjamin brought Yaakov comfort after the loss of his mother and brother, and Judah warned Joseph about the consequences of harming Benjamin. The Rabbi discusses the importance of accents and vowel signs in Hebrew for grammatical accuracy and differentiating tenses, Midrash recommends traveling with righteous men and avoiding wicked companions, and the Targum highlights Jacob's fear of losing Benjamin. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה כְּבֹאִי֙ אֶל־עַבְדְּךָ֣ אָבִ֔י וְהַנַּ֖עַר אֵינֶ֣נּוּ אִתָּ֑נוּ וְנַפְשׁ֖וֹ קְשׁוּרָ֥ה בְנַפְשֽׁוֹ׃|30 J|“Now, if I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us—since his own life is so bound up with his—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of possessing unpretentiousness and complete love for the tzaddik, as seen in the bond between Yonatan and David [Likutei Moharan 135:4:2]. Commentary highlights Judah's concern for Benjamin's return, emphasizing the deep connection between Benjamin and their father. Kabbalah discusses the binding of the divine masculine and feminine aspects symbolized by phylacteries. Liturgy mentions Abraham consecrating Isaac in the Selichot prayer for the Fast of Gedaliah. Quoting Commentary explains the term "hamekusharoth" in Genesis 30:41 as males closely following females, similar to the bond between Yehudah and Binyamin. Targum translates Joseph's statement in Genesis 44:30 as Jacob's soul being bound up with Benjamin's soul, showing Jacob's deep love for his youngest son. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה כִּרְאוֹת֛וֹ כִּי־אֵ֥ין הַנַּ֖עַר וָמֵ֑ת וְהוֹרִ֨ידוּ עֲבָדֶ֜יךָ אֶת־שֵׂיבַ֨ת עַבְדְּךָ֥ אָבִ֛ינוּ בְּיָג֖וֹן שְׁאֹֽלָה׃|31 J|when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will send the white head of your servant our father down to Sheol in grief.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehuda believed Yaakov would die if Binyamin did not return, showing the strong bond between them. Joseph's lack of concern for his father's honor is highlighted in the Talmud, based on his nickname "Bones." Yehuda's emotional speech in Vayigash allows Yosef to understand Yaakov's love for his sons, leading to Yosef revealing his identity. Onkelos translates Jacob's fear of death if Benjamin does not return in Genesis 44:31, expressing the sorrow of Jacob's servants. 

|כִּ֤י עַבְדְּךָ֙ עָרַ֣ב אֶת־הַנַּ֔עַר מֵעִ֥ם אָבִ֖י לֵאמֹ֑ר אִם־לֹ֤א אֲבִיאֶ֙נּוּ֙ אֵלֶ֔יךָ וְחָטָ֥אתִי לְאָבִ֖י כׇּל־הַיָּמִֽים׃|32 J|Now your servant has pledged himself for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I shall stand guilty before my father forever.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah takes responsibility for Benjamin's safety, offering to be a slave in his place, leading to Joseph revealing himself and reconciliation. In the Midrash, Judah's anxiety over Benjamin, past actions, and humility are highlighted. Judah's curse and acceptance of excommunication are discussed in Musar, emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness from God. In the Commentary, Judah confesses his sins, invokes a curse upon himself, and leads to atonement. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain Judah becoming surety for Benjamin's return to his father. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה יֵֽשֶׁב־נָ֤א עַבְדְּךָ֙ תַּ֣חַת הַנַּ֔עַר עֶ֖בֶד לַֽאדֹנִ֑י וְהַנַּ֖עַר יַ֥עַל עִם־אֶחָֽיו׃|33 J|Therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go back with his brothers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah offers to become a slave in place of Benjamin to prevent sinning against his father, showcasing his strength for war and service despite believing Joseph's accusations are baseless. This act of selflessness and repentance leads to Yehudah becoming the ancestor of Israel's kings, highlighting the principle that a penitent stands higher than a perfectly righteous individual. The Targum and Tosefta also discuss Judah's offer to take Benjamin's place, with the Tosefta attributing Yehudah's merit for kingship to his actions of admitting his wrongdoings, saving his brother, and sanctifying God's name. 

|כִּי־אֵיךְ֙ אֶֽעֱלֶ֣ה אֶל־אָבִ֔י וְהַנַּ֖עַר אֵינֶ֣נּוּ אִתִּ֑י פֶּ֚ן אֶרְאֶ֣ה בָרָ֔ע אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִמְצָ֖א אֶת־אָבִֽי׃|34 J|For how can I go back to my father unless the boy is with me? Let me not be witness to the woe that would overtake my father!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehuda's selfless devotion to his father outweighed personal gain, serving as a lesson for Bnei Yisrael in their relationship with God. Judah's plea for Benjamin's release highlights the importance of empathy and genuine concern for others. Joseph tests his brothers to ensure they have changed, with Judah's speech about their father's grief playing a crucial role in the events. Targum interpretations also emphasize the concern for returning without Benjamin and the potential harm to Jacob. 

## Genesis 45

|וְלֹֽא־יָכֹ֨ל יוֹסֵ֜ף לְהִתְאַפֵּ֗ק לְכֹ֤ל הַנִּצָּבִים֙ עָלָ֔יו וַיִּקְרָ֕א הוֹצִ֥יאוּ כׇל־אִ֖ישׁ מֵעָלָ֑י וְלֹא־עָ֤מַד אִישׁ֙ אִתּ֔וֹ בְּהִתְוַדַּ֥ע יוֹסֵ֖ף אֶל־אֶחָֽיו׃|1 J|Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Have everyone withdraw from me!” So there was no one else about when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehuda's approach to Yosef led to redemption through truth, exemplifying acceptance of reality and humbling oneself before Hashem, as seen in the story of Yosef and his brothers. Joseph revealed himself to his brothers in private to prevent embarrassment and protect their reputation, showing mercy despite past grievances. Rabbi Chama bar Chaninah and Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman emphasize the importance of obtaining permission before entering the presence of a king, as seen in Joseph's actions in Genesis 45:1. Abraham rejects the doctrines of the body and human commission, declaring his appointment by God as the controller of external matters. Yoseif cried and asked everyone to leave before revealing himself to his brothers in Genesis 45:1, according to both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אֶת־קֹל֖וֹ בִּבְכִ֑י וַיִּשְׁמְע֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע בֵּ֥ית פַּרְעֹֽה׃|2 J|His sobs were so loud that the Egyptians could hear, and so the news reached Pharaoh’s palace.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 45:2, various commentators explain that Joseph's weeping was heard by the people of Egypt and Pharaoh's household, emphasizing the honesty and emotion behind his tears. In Jewish thought, moral imperfections can hinder prophetic inspiration, with examples like anger causing Elisha to lose prophecy. In Midrash Bereshit Rabbah, Joseph's brothers could not withstand his rebuke, showing the power of divine insight. Additionally, the Talmud discusses the significance of priests wearing the appropriate garments in the Sanctuary, with death penalties for those who do not adhere to the rules. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also mention Joseph's loud weeping in front of the Egyptians and Pharaoh's household. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יוֹסֵ֤ף אֶל־אֶחָיו֙ אֲנִ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף הַע֥וֹד אָבִ֖י חָ֑י וְלֹֽא־יָכְל֤וּ אֶחָיו֙ לַעֲנ֣וֹת אֹת֔וֹ כִּ֥י נִבְהֲל֖וּ מִפָּנָֽיו׃|3 E|Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still well?” But his brothers could not answer him, so dumbfounded were they on account of him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers initially feared Yosef but later recognized his righteousness and leadership, symbolized by his encompassing trait of connection, accepting his guidance as essential for preparing for redemption. Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, causing fear and shame, with the brothers astonished by his sudden appearance as a powerful ruler and scared of potential retaliation for selling him into slavery. The text discusses the gradual revelation of the Divine Presence to Israel, comparing it to how Joseph revealed himself to his brothers little by little, emphasizing the importance of righteousness and meekness in seeking protection. Yosef feared his father had rejected him, but after revealing himself to his brothers, he realized his father still loved and grieved for him, leading him to inquire about his father's well-being before anything else. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יוֹסֵ֧ף אֶל־אֶחָ֛יו גְּשׁוּ־נָ֥א אֵלַ֖י וַיִּגָּ֑שׁוּ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אֲנִי֙ יוֹסֵ֣ף אֲחִיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־מְכַרְתֶּ֥ם אֹתִ֖י מִצְרָֽיְמָה׃|4 J|Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come forward to me.” And when they came forward, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, he whom you sold into Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef attributes his righteousness and success to being sold by his brothers, showing that everyone has a specific place designed for them. Yosef's revelation of his identity to his brothers was to prevent humiliation and destruction of Egypt, emphasizing his high status and urging them to bring their father to Egypt. The brothers were complicit in the sale, even though they did not physically carry it out, leading to Joseph's eventual slavery in Egypt. 

|וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ אַל־תֵּעָ֣צְב֗וּ וְאַל־יִ֙חַר֙ בְּעֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם כִּֽי־מְכַרְתֶּ֥ם אֹתִ֖י הֵ֑נָּה כִּ֣י לְמִֽחְיָ֔ה שְׁלָחַ֥נִי אֱלֹהִ֖ים לִפְנֵיכֶֽם׃|5 J|Now, do not be distressed or reproach yourselves because you sold me hither; it was to save life that God sent me ahead of you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the brothers' repentance over selling Joseph, with their acknowledgment of the sin after over twenty years. Commentary emphasizes Joseph's reassurance to his brothers that selling him was part of God's plan for their benefit. Jewish Thought explains the necessity of expulsion from Eden to maintain human nature, while Midrash discusses the brothers' plot to kill Joseph and the consequences of their actions. Musar focuses on Joseph's forgiveness and discretion, linking it to the concept of the משיח בן יוסף. Quoting Commentary discusses Ibn Ezra and Rashi's interpretations of biblical verses related to Joseph, and Tanakh emphasizes God's role in managing events to achieve His desired outcome, as seen in the story of Joseph. Targum interprets Genesis 45:5 as Joseph reassuring his brothers about God's plan in selling him into slavery. 

|כִּי־זֶ֛ה שְׁנָתַ֥יִם הָרָעָ֖ב בְּקֶ֣רֶב הָאָ֑רֶץ וְעוֹד֙ חָמֵ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵין־חָרִ֖ישׁ וְקָצִֽיר׃|6 J|It is now two years that there has been famine in the land, and there are still five years to come in which there shall be no yield from tilling.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph reminds his brothers of the two years of famine that have passed and the five more to come, emphasizing his role as the provider sent by God to Egypt. The Midrash discusses famines throughout history, highlighting major catastrophes for powerful figures and the consequences of leaving the Land of Israel during famine. Nachmanides and Ramban explain how the experiences of Abraham and Jacob in Egypt foreshadow the Israelites' later exile. The Talmud calculates Jacob's age upon arriving in Egypt during the famine and explains the deduction of two years from every century for Jubilee Year and Sabbatical cycles. The Targum and Tosefta mention the impact of blessings on households during times of famine and prosperity. 

|וַיִּשְׁלָחֵ֤נִי אֱלֹהִים֙ לִפְנֵיכֶ֔ם לָשׂ֥וּם לָכֶ֛ם שְׁאֵרִ֖ית בָּאָ֑רֶץ וּלְהַחֲי֣וֹת לָכֶ֔ם לִפְלֵיטָ֖ה גְּדֹלָֽה׃|7 J|God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of being present in both heaven and earth for true perfection, leaving a legacy behind on earth. The commentary on Joseph and his brothers raises questions about their actions and motivations, while Kabbalah discusses the impact of separation from loved ones on the presence of the Holy Spirit. The Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah highlights the significance of telling the story of the Exodus to remember God's wonders, with Abraham declaring his commission from God in the Second Temple period. Targum interpretations of Genesis 45:7 emphasize God sending Joseph ahead for the family's survival and a great deliverance. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה לֹֽא־אַתֶּ֞ם שְׁלַחְתֶּ֤ם אֹתִי֙ הֵ֔נָּה כִּ֖י הָאֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיְשִׂימֵ֨נִֽי לְאָ֜ב לְפַרְעֹ֗ה וּלְאָדוֹן֙ לְכׇל־בֵּית֔וֹ וּמֹשֵׁ֖ל בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|8 J|So, it was not you who sent me here, but God—who has made me a father to Pharaoh,  lord of all his household, and ruler over the whole land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's rise to power in Egypt was orchestrated by God as part of a larger divine plan, leading him to forgive his brothers and understand their actions as part of God's design. The text explores the consequences of man's freewill being ascribed to God, Jacob's blessings and burial request, Joseph's objections to blessing placement, and the impact of Joseph's rebuke on his brothers. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and divine retribution, drawing parallels between Joseph's actions and those of his descendants. Joseph reassures his brothers that his presence in Egypt was God's will to save lives during a famine, highlighting his role as a connector between generations. In Isaiah 22:15, God instructs the prophet to confront Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace. The Targum also emphasizes that Joseph's leadership in Egypt was part of God's plan, not his brothers'. 

|מַהֲרוּ֮ וַעֲל֣וּ אֶל־אָבִי֒ וַאֲמַרְתֶּ֣ם אֵלָ֗יו כֹּ֤ה אָמַר֙ בִּנְךָ֣ יוֹסֵ֔ף שָׂמַ֧נִי אֱלֹהִ֛ים לְאָד֖וֹן לְכׇל־מִצְרָ֑יִם רְדָ֥ה אֵלַ֖י אַֽל־תַּעֲמֹֽד׃|9 J|“Now, hurry back to my father and say to him: Thus says your son Joseph, ‘God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me without delay.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph urgently instructs his brothers to inform their father that God has made him a ruler over Egypt, inviting Jacob to come to Goshen to prevent delay in the Israelites' exile. The Midrash discusses Joseph's revelation to his brothers, paralleling it to the Day of Judgment and highlighting the suffering of the righteous. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban emphasize the Divine Presence and reassurance of safety in Egypt under Joseph's rule. Simchat HaRegel underscores Divine Providence in the Israelites' journey from idol worship to redemption. Jacob's prayer in the Second Temple criticizes Joseph for relying on his own wisdom. The Targums also detail Joseph's urgent message to his brothers to inform Jacob of his position in Egypt and to come without delay. 

|וְיָשַׁבְתָּ֣ בְאֶֽרֶץ־גֹּ֗שֶׁן וְהָיִ֤יתָ קָרוֹב֙ אֵלַ֔י אַתָּ֕ה וּבָנֶ֖יךָ וּבְנֵ֣י בָנֶ֑יךָ וְצֹאנְךָ֥ וּבְקָרְךָ֖ וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁר־לָֽךְ׃|10 J|You will dwell in the region of Goshen, where you will be near me—you and your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all that is yours.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph tells Jacob that they will settle in the land of Goshen, away from the royal palace in Egypt, to be near Joseph and close to Canaan. God promises in Exodus 8:18 to spare Goshen from swarms of insects as a sign of His presence among His people. Joseph informs his brothers that they will live in Goshen with their descendants, livestock, and possessions. (Onkelos Genesis 45:10, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 45:10) 

|וְכִלְכַּלְתִּ֤י אֹֽתְךָ֙ שָׁ֔ם כִּי־ע֛וֹד חָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִ֖ים רָעָ֑ב פֶּן־תִּוָּרֵ֛שׁ אַתָּ֥ה וּבֵֽיתְךָ֖ וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁר־לָֽךְ׃|11 J|There I will provide for you—for there are yet five years of famine to come—that you and your household and all that is yours may not suffer want.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph strategically moved his family to Goshen near Egypt's capital to avoid suspicion of profiteering, ensuring their well-being during the famine and fulfilling God's providence. The Midrash emphasizes the blessings that follow the righteous, with Jacob blessing Pharaoh and Joseph providing for his family during the famine. Rabbi Yoseph and Zevach Pesach clarify the intentions behind Jacob's family's temporary stay in Egypt. The Targum mentions Joseph's provision for his family during the remaining years of famine, while the Tosefta highlights the impact of specific individuals on the blessings received by Isaac, Laban, Potiphar, and the Egyptians. 

|וְהִנֵּ֤ה עֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ רֹא֔וֹת וְעֵינֵ֖י אָחִ֣י בִנְיָמִ֑ין כִּי־פִ֖י הַֽמְדַבֵּ֥ר אֲלֵיכֶֽם׃|12 J|You can see for yourselves, and my brother Benjamin for himself, that it is indeed I who am speaking to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the presence of light and darkness within human intellect is discussed, with the words of a tzaddik refining the intellect. Joseph's ability to speak in Hebrew to his brothers is highlighted in the commentary, emphasizing his authority as ruler of Egypt. Israel's redemption from Egypt is attributed to their maintenance of identity and moral standards, as discussed in Jewish Thought and the Midrash. Rabbi Elazar explains Joseph's lack of resentment towards his brothers in the Talmud, while in the Targum, Joseph reassures his brothers by speaking to them in their own language. 

|וְהִגַּדְתֶּ֣ם לְאָבִ֗י אֶת־כׇּל־כְּבוֹדִי֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר רְאִיתֶ֑ם וּמִֽהַרְתֶּ֛ם וְהוֹרַדְתֶּ֥ם אֶת־אָבִ֖י הֵֽנָּה׃|13 J|And you must tell my father everything about my high station in Egypt and all that you have seen; and bring my father here with all speed.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers initially feared Yosef but later recognized his righteousness and leadership qualities, leading to their acceptance and alignment with him as they acknowledged the beginning of the exile and the importance of his role in preparing for ultimate redemption. Joseph wanted his father to know that he had the power to ensure his father would be treated with respect and deference in Egypt, so he instructed his brothers to tell their father about his glory and capabilities as a ruler, urging them to bring their father down to Egypt quickly so he could see it all for himself. Jacob did not intend to settle in Egypt, only wanting to see Joseph and return to Canaan, but God reassured him in a dream at Beersheba that he could go to Egypt, as the promise was to both Jacob the individual and the nation. In Genesis 45:13, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both translate Joseph's request to tell his father about his honor in Egypt and to bring him down quickly. 

|וַיִּפֹּ֛ל עַל־צַוְּארֵ֥י בִנְיָמִֽן־אָחִ֖יו וַיֵּ֑בְךְּ וּבִ֨נְיָמִ֔ן בָּכָ֖ה עַל־צַוָּארָֽיו׃|14 J|With that he embraced  his brother Benjamin around the neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph wept over the future destruction of the Temples in Benjamin's portion, while Benjamin wept for the Tabernacle in Shiloh in Joseph's portion. The five changes of raiment given to Benjamin hinted at Mordecai's future royal attire. Rabbi Elazar explains that Joseph cried over the destruction of the two Temples that were destined to be in Benjamin's territory, while Benjamin cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in Joseph's territory. The Targum also highlights this connection, emphasizing the future destruction of the holy temple in Benjamin's portion and the tabernacle of Shiloh in Joseph's portion. 

|וַיְנַשֵּׁ֥ק לְכׇל־אֶחָ֖יו וַיֵּ֣בְךְּ עֲלֵהֶ֑ם וְאַ֣חֲרֵי כֵ֔ן דִּבְּר֥וּ אֶחָ֖יו אִתּֽוֹ׃|15 J|He kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; only then were his brothers able to talk to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's tears and kisses allowed for open communication and reconciliation with his brothers, demonstrating the importance of remorse before salvation can be attained. Radak explains that "Kiss the son" signifies respect and submission to God's authority, with the word בר also meaning "chosen." In the Targum, Joseph's tears were shed upon realizing his people would be enslaved. 

|וְהַקֹּ֣ל נִשְׁמַ֗ע בֵּ֤ית פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר בָּ֖אוּ אֲחֵ֣י יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיִּיטַב֙ בְּעֵינֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה וּבְעֵינֵ֖י עֲבָדָֽיו׃|16 J|The news reached Pharaoh’s palace: “Joseph’s brothers have come.” Pharaoh and his courtiers were pleased.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The word 'va'ata' signifies repentance in Chasidut, with Joseph's brothers correcting their sin through their pain over Binyamin. In the Commentary, the arrival of Joseph's brothers in Egypt confirmed Joseph's status as a distinguished leader, causing rejoicing among the Egyptians. In Jewish Thought, Shama‘ is used homonymously to mean both "to hear" and "to obey." In the Midrash, Judah's recognition of Joseph caused chaos, while Joseph is praised and likened to a faultless dove. Quoting Commentary, studying other areas of wisdom enhances Torah understanding. In Second Temple, Pharaoh saw the arrival of Joseph's brothers as an opportunity to tempt towards desire. In Targum, Pharaoh and his servants were pleased to hear of Joseph's brothers' arrival. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף אֱמֹ֥ר אֶל־אַחֶ֖יךָ זֹ֣את עֲשׂ֑וּ טַֽעֲנוּ֙ אֶת־בְּעִ֣ירְכֶ֔ם וּלְכוּ־בֹ֖אוּ אַ֥רְצָה כְּנָֽעַן׃|17 J|And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do as follows: load up your beasts and go at once to the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra connects the word "ta'anu" to "meto'ane," Sforno explains the purpose of taking Jacob to Egypt, Or HaChaim notes Pharaoh's command to take wagons, Radak explains "beasts" as a collective term, Tur HaArokh clarifies prodding the beasts, Rav Hirsch discusses animal-related Hebrew words, Rashi interprets "load your beasts" as loading them with grain, Steinsaltz notes Pharaoh's trust in Joseph's judgment, and Tze'enah Ure'enah explains Pharaoh's orders to send grain to Canaan and bring Jacob to Egypt. Midrash recounts Pharaoh's offer of the finest land in Egypt, Joseph's gifts to Benjamin and food for the journey, and advice to study Torah and enter the city before sunset. Ibn Ezra interprets Isaiah 14:19 as "pierced" with wounds, comparing it to the Arabic word for "pierce" and noting a possible connection to the Hebrew word for "load." Targum states Pharaoh instructs Joseph's brothers to load their animals and go to Canaan. 

|וּקְח֧וּ אֶת־אֲבִיכֶ֛ם וְאֶת־בָּתֵּיכֶ֖ם וּבֹ֣אוּ אֵלָ֑י וְאֶתְּנָ֣ה לָכֶ֗ם אֶת־טוּב֙ אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם וְאִכְל֖וּ אֶת־חֵ֥לֶב הָאָֽרֶץ׃|18 J|Take your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you shall live off the fat of the land.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh prophesied about the Jewish people's Exodus actions by promising them the best land in Egypt, symbolized by the term "fat of the land." Certain forbidden fats are liable for kerat in sacrifices, while the fat-tail is permitted. Joseph's brothers were promised the finest land by Pharaoh, and Joseph sent gifts to his family before they journeyed to Egypt. Ramban explains the distinction between cheilev and shuman, supporting the tradition that the fat tail is not cheilev. In Targum, "the best of the land of Egypt" is translated as "the best of what is desirable in the land of Mizraim," emphasizing the invitation to enjoy the best of the land. 

|וְאַתָּ֥ה צֻוֵּ֖יתָה זֹ֣את עֲשׂ֑וּ קְחוּ־לָכֶם֩ מֵאֶ֨רֶץ מִצְרַ֜יִם עֲגָל֗וֹת לְטַפְּכֶם֙ וְלִנְשֵׁיכֶ֔ם וּנְשָׂאתֶ֥ם אֶת־אֲבִיכֶ֖ם וּבָאתֶֽם׃|19 J|And you are bidden [to add], ‘Do as follows: take from the land of Egypt wagons for your children and your wives, and bring your father here.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh allowed Joseph to bring carriages and animals to Egypt for his family's journey, showing trust in Joseph's integrity and ensuring their comfort. The sons of Jacob prioritized carrying their father over their own families, demonstrating their commitment to honoring parents. The Targum states that Joseph instructed his brothers to bring wagons from Egypt to transport their families and father to him. 

|וְעֵ֣ינְכֶ֔ם אַל־תָּחֹ֖ס עַל־כְּלֵיכֶ֑ם כִּי־ט֛וּב כׇּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם לָכֶ֥ם הֽוּא׃|20 J|And never mind your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt shall be yours.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, and Da'at Zekenim all emphasize Joseph's advice to his brothers not to worry about leaving belongings behind when moving to Egypt. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also convey this message, stating that the best of Egypt belongs to them. 

|וַיַּֽעֲשׂוּ־כֵן֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיִּתֵּ֨ן לָהֶ֥ם יוֹסֵ֛ף עֲגָל֖וֹת עַל־פִּ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וַיִּתֵּ֥ן לָהֶ֛ם צֵדָ֖ה לַדָּֽרֶךְ׃|21 J|The sons of Israel did so; Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had commanded, and he supplied them with provisions for the journey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers quickly followed his instructions, using wagons provided by Pharaoh to return to Canaan with plenty of food and other items as a sign of forgiveness and Joseph's identity. Judah was sent ahead to establish an academy for Joseph to teach Torah, reflecting the importance of Torah study in the lineage of Abraham. The word "צֵדָה" in Nehemiah 13:15 refers to provisions, as clarified by Rashi, who also explains the word "רֻטֲפַש" in Job 33:25. Yoseif gave wagons and provisions to the sons of Yisrael as ordered by Pharaoh (Onkelos Genesis 45:21, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 45:21). 

|לְכֻלָּ֥ם נָתַ֛ן לָאִ֖ישׁ חֲלִפ֣וֹת שְׂמָלֹ֑ת וּלְבִנְיָמִ֤ן נָתַן֙ שְׁלֹ֣שׁ מֵא֣וֹת כֶּ֔סֶף וְחָמֵ֖שׁ חֲלִפֹ֥ת שְׂמָלֹֽת׃|22 J|To each of them, moreover, he gave a change of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and several  changes of clothing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef's gifts of three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothes to Binyamin symbolize future events, including Mordechai's role in the Purim story. The garments represent spiritual levels needing rectification through exile, aligning with the tradition of changing clothes on Purim. Benjamin's special treatment reflects his innocence in Joseph's sale, while Yosef's actions carry deep symbolism of forgiveness, compensation, and foreshadowing future events, as seen in various commentaries and Midrashic interpretations. The significance of clothing, favoritism, and the senses in relation to Joseph's story is highlighted in different sources like the Musar and Talmud, emphasizing the intricate layers of meaning in the biblical narrative. 

|וּלְאָבִ֞יו שָׁלַ֤ח כְּזֹאת֙ עֲשָׂרָ֣ה חֲמֹרִ֔ים נֹשְׂאִ֖ים מִטּ֣וּב מִצְרָ֑יִם וְעֶ֣שֶׂר אֲתֹנֹ֡ת נֹֽ֠שְׂאֹ֠ת בָּ֣ר וָלֶ֧חֶם וּמָז֛וֹן לְאָבִ֖יו לַדָּֽרֶךְ׃|23 J|And to his father he sent the following: ten he-asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain, bread, and provisions for his father on the journey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph sent his father gifts consisting of ten male and female donkeys carrying provisions and quality clothing for their journey to Egypt, ensuring nothing was lacking for their household. Joseph did not burden Benjamin with a donkey. The gifts included aged wine with mystical significance, connecting the elderly to higher spiritual realms. The Talmud discusses the contents of the gifts, with one opinion focusing on aged wine and another considering everything as food. The Targum specifies that male donkeys carried wine and luxury items, while female donkeys carried grain and bread for the journey. 

|וַיְשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־אֶחָ֖יו וַיֵּלֵ֑כוּ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם אַֽל־תִּרְגְּז֖וּ בַּדָּֽרֶךְ׃|24 J|As he sent his brothers off on their way, he told them, “Do not be quarrelsome on the way.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph instructed his brothers not to engage in halachic discussions while on their journey to Egypt, to avoid quarreling and focus on their safety and protection under his authority. He provided them with provisions for the journey and emphasized the importance of trust and unity among them, ensuring they would reach their destination safely. 

|וַֽיַּעֲל֖וּ מִמִּצְרָ֑יִם וַיָּבֹ֙אוּ֙ אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֲבִיהֶֽם׃|25 J|They went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text describes Joseph's brothers returning from Egypt to Canaan to inform Jacob of Joseph being alive. Eretz Yisrael is portrayed as superior to other lands, with a higher and more productive nature, including the Temple. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan confirm the brothers' journey from Egypt to Canaan to see Jacob. 

|וַיַּגִּ֨דוּ ל֜וֹ לֵאמֹ֗ר ע֚וֹד יוֹסֵ֣ף חַ֔י וְכִֽי־ה֥וּא מֹשֵׁ֖ל בְּכׇל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וַיָּ֣פׇג לִבּ֔וֹ כִּ֥י לֹא־הֶאֱמִ֖ין לָהֶֽם׃|26 J|And they told him, “Joseph is still alive; yes, he is ruler over the whole land of Egypt.” His heart went numb, for he did not believe them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Joseph's reassurance to Yaakov about their exile in Egypt leading to redemption through symbolic carriages, while Commentary explains Jacob's shock and revival upon hearing the news, with Joseph's gradual revelation contributing to their reunion. Jewish Thought highlights the homonymous use of "Shama" in hearing and obeying, emphasizing prayers for Mashiach ben Yosef. Midrash mentions Jacob sending Judah to establish a Torah academy, while Quoting Commentary discusses physical reactions to overwhelming joy. Second Temple texts mention ecstasy experiences, and Talmud explores the consequences of lying. Targum describes Yaakov's uncertainty upon hearing about Joseph. 

|וַיְדַבְּר֣וּ אֵלָ֗יו אֵ֣ת כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֤י יוֹסֵף֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבֶּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם וַיַּרְא֙ אֶת־הָ֣עֲגָל֔וֹת אֲשֶׁר־שָׁלַ֥ח יוֹסֵ֖ף לָשֵׂ֣את אֹת֑וֹ וַתְּחִ֕י ר֖וּחַ יַעֲקֹ֥ב אֲבִיהֶֽם׃|27 J|But when they recounted all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's spirit was revived upon seeing the wagons sent by Yosef, symbolizing the connection between worldly matters and the divine; Yosef hinted at redemption and inheritance of Israel. The brothers lied to Yaakov about selling Yosef, who was unaware of their actions until seeing the carriages sent by Yosef, reviving his spirit and prophetic insights. The Rambam believes Yaakov criticized Shimon and Levi for selling Yosef, while the Ramban disagrees. Moral imperfections can lessen prophetic inspiration, with certain vices causing it to be entirely withdrawn. The Holy Spirit withdraws during spiritual separation but returns upon reconnection, as seen with Yaakov and Yosef. The sale of Yosef led to a famine, but his brothers' reunion in Egypt lifted the excommunication pact and revived Yaakov's spirit. Judah's bones rolled until Moses implored mercy, Jacob's soul was restored upon learning Yosef was alive, and Israel's death reflected a higher spiritual level. Rashi explains that Yaakov's spirit was revived upon reuniting with Yosef, and Da'at Zekenim discusses how the Holy Spirit returned when the brothers' oath was released. Rabbi Shimon discusses the punishment for a liar using the example of Yaakov's sons deceiving him about Yosef, with some suggesting Yaakov regained the Holy Spirit upon learning the truth. In Deuteronomy 21, laws regarding unknown murders, captive women, inheritance, wayward sons, and burial practices are outlined. Yaakov's spirit of prophecy was revived upon hearing Yosef's words and seeing the wagons sent by him. 

|וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל רַ֛ב עוֹד־יוֹסֵ֥ף בְּנִ֖י חָ֑י אֵֽלְכָ֥ה וְאֶרְאֶ֖נּוּ בְּטֶ֥רֶם אָמֽוּת׃|28 J|“Enough!” said Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov was overjoyed to hear that Joseph was still alive after 22 years, as it showed that Joseph had remained true to his tradition and teachings despite being exposed to negative influences in Egypt. The Gemara provides advice on how to navigate desires and joys through four levels of birrur, starting with curbing lust with thoughts of mortality, then studying Torah, reciting the Shema, and finally contemplating death. Jacob expressed his immense joy that Joseph was alive, indicating that his position in Egypt was inconsequential compared to the fact that his son was still alive. Jacob's sons return to Canaan with news of Joseph being alive, and they use Serach to gently break the news to Jacob. Jacob's faith is restored, and he plans to see Joseph before he dies. Joseph reveals his true identity to his family, emphasizing that it was part of God's plan and urging them to prepare to migrate to Egypt. Israel expresses great joy and gratitude for the unexpected news that his son Joseph is still alive, after being delivered from various dangers. 

## Genesis 46

|וַיִּסַּ֤ע יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֔וֹ וַיָּבֹ֖א בְּאֵ֣רָה שָּׁ֑בַע וַיִּזְבַּ֣ח זְבָחִ֔ים לֵאלֹהֵ֖י אָבִ֥יו יִצְחָֽק׃|1 E|So Israel set out with all that was his, and he came to Beer-sheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac’s [house].|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov offered sacrifices to God at Beer-sheba in honor of his father Yitzchak, seeking to bring Divine approval to his decision to go to Egypt, with the sacrifices symbolizing a desire to perfect character traits and restore the Holy Spirit. The act of honoring his father over his grandfather by offering sacrifices to Isaac's God is emphasized, with the sacrifices aimed at harmonizing divine attributes and seeking guidance and assurance from God. The text also explores Jacob's actions in relation to his father's blessings and suffering, with the burnt-offering symbolizing the study of the book. Israel traveled to Beersheba with all his possessions and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac, emphasizing the journey and the changing names of Jacob and Israel. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ לְיִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בְּמַרְאֹ֣ת הַלַּ֔יְלָה וַיֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֣ב ׀ יַעֲקֹ֑ב וַיֹּ֖אמֶר הִנֵּֽנִי׃|2 E|God called to Israel in a vision by night: “Jacob! Jacob!” He answered, “Here.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses was unique among prophets as he did not need to separate from his physical self to receive prophecy, remaining humble and connected to both realms [Chasidut]. The repetition of Jacob's name signifies a shift in his role from contending with spiritual forces to enduring slavery in Egypt [Commentary]. Maimonides highlights the principle of prophecy involving the senses ceasing to act and the influence of the Active Intellect on the rational and imaginative faculties [Jewish Thought]. In Kabbalistic teachings, the repetition of a name signifies the unity of an individual's spiritual aspects, reflecting a completion or unity of the spirit [Kabbalah]. The repetition of names like "Moses, Moses" in the Midrash signifies affection and encouragement, highlighting a deep connection to both this world and the world to come [Midrash]. The Tosefta states that double expressions of names are expressions of love and encouragement, indicating praise for the individual [Tosefta]. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אָנֹכִ֥י הָאֵ֖ל אֱלֹהֵ֣י אָבִ֑יךָ אַל־תִּירָא֙ מֵרְדָ֣ה מִצְרַ֔יְמָה כִּֽי־לְג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל אֲשִֽׂימְךָ֥ שָֽׁם׃|3 E|“I am God, the God of your father’s [house]. Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will make you there into a great nation.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that when a tzaddik leaves his hometown, a void is felt by those left behind, as seen with Yaakov leaving Canaan for Charan, taking his spiritual assets with him. Ibn Ezra explains the missing root in "me-redah," Sforno clarifies God's reassurance to Jacob about avoiding intermarriage in Egypt, and Radak highlights the promise of Jacob becoming a great nation there. Jewish Thought notes the preordained events leading to Pesach, the voluntary move to Egypt, and challenges the idea that wickedness leads to a loss of free will. Midrashic commentators discuss the significance of God's identification to Moshe and the blessings given to Abraham in relation to his descendants. God emphasizes the contrast between Israelites' enslavement in Egypt and their current freedom, with the redemption being necessary for imprisoned souls (Or HaChaim). The promises made to the patriarchs were conditional on worthiness, seen in the growth and multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt (Da'at Zekenim, Chizkuni). Targum Jonathan reassures Jacob of becoming a great nation in Egypt despite the servitude decreed with Abraham. 

|אָנֹכִ֗י אֵרֵ֤ד עִמְּךָ֙ מִצְרַ֔יְמָה וְאָנֹכִ֖י אַֽעַלְךָ֣ גַם־עָלֹ֑ה וְיוֹסֵ֕ף יָשִׁ֥ית יָד֖וֹ עַל־עֵינֶֽיךָ׃|4 E|I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will also bring you back; and Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that sacrificing oneself and recognizing God's presence in descent leads to spiritual elevation, as seen in Jacob's journey to Egypt. Various commentaries emphasize God's presence with Jacob in Egypt and the promise of returning to the Holy Land. Jewish thought discusses interpretations of corporeality in the Pentateuch and character traits of Jacob's sons. Kabbalah highlights the Shechinah's presence with the Jewish people in exile, while Midrash emphasizes God's protection and involvement with the Israelites. Musar reflects on the Shechinah's connection to Israel in exile, and the Second Temple commentary discusses God's continuous presence. The Talmud addresses seeking mercy from the Patriarchs and symbolism in dreams, while the Targum emphasizes God's promise to accompany the Israelites to Egypt and bring them back up again. 

|וַיָּ֥קׇם יַעֲקֹ֖ב מִבְּאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע וַיִּשְׂא֨וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל אֶת־יַעֲקֹ֣ב אֲבִיהֶ֗ם וְאֶת־טַפָּם֙ וְאֶת־נְשֵׁיהֶ֔ם בָּעֲגָל֕וֹת אֲשֶׁר־שָׁלַ֥ח פַּרְעֹ֖ה לָשֵׂ֥את אֹתֽוֹ׃|5 J E|So Jacob set out from Beer-sheba. The sons of Israel put their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport him;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's children are called "the Children of Israel" for the first time, symbolizing their dual task towards God and their environment. Pharaoh's decree for exile was seen as determined by God, with the children of Israel repaying Yaakov by carrying him across the river. Despite his previous strengths, Yaakov's circumstances changed over time, and God promised to make him a great nation in Egypt, with Joseph caring for him and eventually bringing him back to the Land of Israel after his death. The title "the children of Israel" was used before the Torah was given, and the Jubilee Year is counted as one year of a Sabbatical cycle with two years deducted from every century. Yaakov's departure from Beer Sheva was made easier with God's promise, and his family traveled in wagons provided by Pharaoh, with the sons riding on the animals while the elderly Yaakov sat. 

|וַיִּקְח֣וּ אֶת־מִקְנֵיהֶ֗ם וְאֶת־רְכוּשָׁם֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר רָֽכְשׁוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ מִצְרָ֑יְמָה יַעֲקֹ֖ב וְכׇל־זַרְע֥וֹ אִתּֽוֹ׃|6 P|and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in the land of Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob and his sons brought their livestock and possessions with them to Egypt, giving away possessions acquired outside Canaan to Esau in exchange for the Cave of Machpelah. Despite initially intending to only go to the border of Egypt, Jacob was compelled by God to go down to Egypt with all his descendants, including daughters of sons, as it was seen as a place of economic refuge during times of famine. God reassured Jacob about the migration and promised to eventually bring him back to the Land of Israel, orchestrating the descent to Egypt through Joseph being sold into slavery. (Midrash, Quoting Commentary) 

|בָּנָ֞יו וּבְנֵ֤י בָנָיו֙ אִתּ֔וֹ בְּנֹתָ֛יו וּבְנ֥וֹת בָּנָ֖יו וְכׇל־זַרְע֑וֹ הֵבִ֥יא אִתּ֖וֹ מִצְרָֽיְמָה׃|7 P|he brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, his daughters  and granddaughters—all his offspring.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban and Ibn Ezra debate the use of the plural form "daughters" in Genesis 46:7, with Ramban suggesting it refers to many people in genealogy, while Ibn Ezra proposes it may include maid servants like Dinah. Other commentators suggest the term may refer to daughters-in-law or granddaughters, with Rashi mentioning Serach and Yocheved. In the Midrash, Jacob joyfully goes to Egypt to see Joseph, leading to their settlement in Goshen and prosperity, with God promising to bring Jacob back to Israel after his death. The Torah connects Isaac's wells to Jacob's journey to Egypt, highlighting the importance of individuals like Calev and Joshua, as well as the role of women in attachment to Israel. Additionally, Pallu had a son named Eliab, and Ethan had a son named Azariah in the Tanakh, while the Targum mentions Jacob's entire family accompanying him to Egypt. 

|וְאֵ֨לֶּה שְׁמ֧וֹת בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל הַבָּאִ֥ים מִצְרַ֖יְמָה יַעֲקֹ֣ב וּבָנָ֑יו בְּכֹ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב רְאוּבֵֽן׃|8 P|These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his descendants, who came to Egypt. Jacob’s first-born Reuben;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The seventy righteous individuals in Genesis 46:8:1 refer to Jacob and his sons, demonstrating the importance of family lineage and the miraculous growth of the Jewish nation. The Sefer HaChinukh prohibits clairvoyance, while Contemporary Halakhic Problems explores differing opinions on the status of the recipients of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The Midrash discusses the use of specific words in the Torah and emphasizes the importance of the Tabernacle. In Musar, questions arise about the Midrash's mention of alternate names for Abraham and Jacob. Rashi and Ramban provide insights on the significance of Jacob being referred to as both Jacob and Israel. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan list the names of Jacob's sons who came to Egypt, with Reuben identified as the firstborn. Isaac's blessings led to prosperity, but oppression followed the deaths of Joseph and his brothers. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י רְאוּבֵ֑ן חֲנ֥וֹךְ וּפַלּ֖וּא וְחֶצְרֹ֥ן וְכַרְמִֽי׃|9 P|Reuben’s sons: Enoch,  Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Reuben are listed as Hanokh, Palu, Hetzron, and Karmi in various commentaries and translations of the Bible, with slight variations in spelling. Additionally, the Torah attributes deaths in the desert not only to the sin of the spies, but also to other specific transgressions such as idol worship and intermarriage. (Genesis 46:9, Numbers 14:35, Numbers 26:8, Numbers 26:64) 

|וּבְנֵ֣י שִׁמְע֗וֹן יְמוּאֵ֧ל וְיָמִ֛ין וְאֹ֖הַד וְיָכִ֣ין וְצֹ֑חַר וְשָׁא֖וּל בֶּן־הַֽכְּנַעֲנִֽית׃|10 P|Simeon’s sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Saul  the son of a Canaanite woman.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Simeon's marriage to a Canaanite woman resulted in the birth of Shaul, who was singled out in Scripture due to his mother's nationality, seen as a breach of tradition. In halakhah, the ovum donor is considered the halachic mother in cases of surrogate motherhood, as seen with Dinah, influencing maternal relationships by conception rather than birth. The land was apportioned to those standing on the Plains of Moav due to the destruction of six families, including Simeon's, who buried Dina in Canaan. Different interpretations suggest various sons of Jacob had different approaches to intermarriage, with Shimon and Judah possibly marrying Canaanite women. Simeon's sons are listed in Exodus 6:15, with Shaul being the son of a Canaanite woman according to Targum. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י לֵוִ֑י גֵּרְשׁ֕וֹן קְהָ֖ת וּמְרָרִֽי׃|11 P|Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The 430 years mentioned in Exodus 12:40 includes the time from the birth of Isaac until the Exodus, with other settlements made by the patriarchs considered sojourning. The Gersonides were listed first in a previous count of Levites from 30 days old and up, while Kehot was listed first in a count of Levites who were thirty years and older, with the addition of "they also" to indicate that this section of Levites was also counted. The sons of Levi are Gershon, Kehath, and Merari according to both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 46:11. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י יְהוּדָ֗ה עֵ֧ר וְאוֹנָ֛ן וְשֵׁלָ֖ה וָפֶ֣רֶץ וָזָ֑רַח וַיָּ֨מׇת עֵ֤ר וְאוֹנָן֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן וַיִּהְי֥וּ בְנֵי־פֶ֖רֶץ חֶצְרֹ֥ן וְחָמֽוּל׃|12 P|Judah’s sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah—but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan; and Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Er and Onan's deaths in Canaan were due to their sins, highlighting the importance of purity and morality within Judah's family. Judah's failure to complete a mitzva led to negative consequences, as seen in the deaths of his sons and wife. The concept of substitution is exemplified through Tamar, Ruth, and David, showing how impurity can be redeemed and lead to purity. The descendants of Judah, such as Bezalel, were also linked to Judah's lineage, emphasizing the significance of their role in the divine plan. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י יִשָּׂשכָ֑ר תּוֹלָ֥ע וּפֻוָ֖ה וְי֥וֹב וְשִׁמְרֹֽן׃|13 P|Issachar’s sons: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puva, Yov, and Shimron, with a custom of changing the vocalization of Yissokhor. Rabbi Meir refutes a Samaritan's claim of descent from Joseph based on the names of Issachar's sons. Jashub, also known as Job, was a Torah scholar from the tribe of Issachar, with the descendants of Jashub and Shimron specified in Numbers 26:24. The Targum describes Issachar's sons as sages and masters of reasoning. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י זְבֻל֑וּן סֶ֥רֶד וְאֵל֖וֹן וְיַחְלְאֵֽל׃|14 P|Zebulun’s sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse lists the sons of Zebulun as Sered, Elon, and Yahle'el, who were known for their skills in commerce and providing for their brothers, the sons of Issakar, receiving a similar reward (Onkelos Genesis 46:14, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 46:14). 

|אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ בְּנֵ֣י לֵאָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָֽלְדָ֤ה לְיַעֲקֹב֙ בְּפַדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֔ם וְאֵ֖ת דִּינָ֣ה בִתּ֑וֹ כׇּל־נֶ֧פֶשׁ בָּנָ֛יו וּבְנוֹתָ֖יו שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וְשָׁלֹֽשׁ׃|15 P|Those were the sons whom Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. Persons in all, male and female: 33. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the missing person in Jacob's descendants as Jochebed, explores the possibility of her longevity, and emphasizes hidden miracles in the Torah. The Jewish Thought commentary highlights the surprise attack against the Midianites, led by Joshua and Pinchas, with specific instructions for purification and loot distribution. The Midrash delves into differing perspectives on fetal formation and offerings related to the exodus from Egypt. Ramban clarifies details about Abraham's birth and lineage, while the Talmud establishes Jochebed's age and resolves the discrepancy in Jacob's family count with the birth of a twin sister. The Targum translations list Leah's sons born in Padan Aram, including Dinah, totaling thirty-three souls. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י גָ֔ד צִפְי֥וֹן וְחַגִּ֖י שׁוּנִ֣י וְאֶצְבֹּ֑ן עֵרִ֥י וַֽאֲרוֹדִ֖י וְאַרְאֵלִֽי׃|16 P|Gad’s sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The seven sons of Gad are listed as Ziphion, Hagi, Shuni, Etzbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli, with different interpretations and symbolic meanings given to their names [Steinsaltz, Musar, Quoting Commentary, Tanakh, Targum]. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י אָשֵׁ֗ר יִמְנָ֧ה וְיִשְׁוָ֛ה וְיִשְׁוִ֥י וּבְרִיעָ֖ה וְשֶׂ֣רַח אֲחֹתָ֑ם וּבְנֵ֣י בְרִיעָ֔ה חֶ֖בֶר וּמַלְכִּיאֵֽל׃|17 P|Asher’s sons: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah’s sons: Heber and Malchiel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Serach, daughter of Asher, is listed as his daughter in Scripture but was actually his wife's daughter from another man, making her the half-sister of Asher's sons. She inherited her father's portion of land due to not having any brothers and is noted for her unique personality and close relationship with Jacob. Serach's genealogy is traced through Lotan rather than Se'ir due to her maternal lineage, and she is mentioned before her status in the list of Yaakov's offspring to highlight her deeds. 

|אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י זִלְפָּ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥ן לָבָ֖ן לְלֵאָ֣ה בִתּ֑וֹ וַתֵּ֤לֶד אֶת־אֵ֙לֶּה֙ לְיַעֲקֹ֔ב שֵׁ֥שׁ עֶשְׂרֵ֖ה נָֽפֶשׁ׃|18 P|These were the descendants of Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah. These she bore to Jacob—16 persons.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 46:18, the Torah lists Zilpah's sons before Rachel's to show the larger number of offspring from Zilpah, who was originally a handmaid. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Zilpah bore sixteen children to Jacob. 

|בְּנֵ֤י רָחֵל֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת יַֽעֲקֹ֔ב יוֹסֵ֖ף וּבִנְיָמִֽן׃|19 P|The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno, Rashi, Steinsaltz, Tze'enah Ure'enah, and Rabbeinu Bahya emphasize Rachel as Jacob's beloved wife and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, the choicest of the tribes. Midrash Bereshit Rabbah and Bamidbar Rabbah highlight Rachel's significance in the house of Israel and the symbolism behind Benjamin's offering. Ramban discusses Jacob's love for Benjamin due to him being Rachel's only son. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both confirm that Joseph and Benjamin were the sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife. 

|וַיִּוָּלֵ֣ד לְיוֹסֵף֮ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ אֲשֶׁ֤ר יָֽלְדָה־לּוֹ֙ אָֽסְנַ֔ת בַּת־פּ֥וֹטִי פֶ֖רַע כֹּהֵ֣ן אֹ֑ן אֶת־מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה וְאֶת־אֶפְרָֽיִם׃|20 P|To Joseph were born in the land of Egypt Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how Yitzchok blesses Esau according to his soul's origin, emphasizing the need for physical sacrifice for the afterlife. In Egypt, Joseph fathers Manasseh and Ephraim with his wife Asenat, who are part of the house of Jacob. Rabbi Pinḥas highlights how David's kindness towards Saul leads to divine mercy and conversions. Rashi explains the linguistic change in Exodus 9:18, while the Second Temple text mentions Machir, son of Manasseh. Targum details the birth of Menasheh and Ephraim to Joseph and Asenath in Egypt. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י בִנְיָמִ֗ן בֶּ֤לַע וָבֶ֙כֶר֙ וְאַשְׁבֵּ֔ל גֵּרָ֥א וְנַעֲמָ֖ן אֵחִ֣י וָרֹ֑אשׁ מֻפִּ֥ים וְחֻפִּ֖ים וָאָֽרְדְּ׃|21 P|Benjamin’s sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Naaman, a son of Benjamin, had ten sons whose names reflected his connection to his lost brother Joseph, showing various aspects of their relationship and eventual reconciliation. The families of Ard and Naaman are considered separate due to their mother being pregnant when they went to Egypt. Benjamin's ten sons are seen as a blessing from God, fulfilling the destiny of the twelve tribes originally meant for Joseph. The descendants of Benjamin were divided into clans, with additional interpretations of their names provided in Targum Jonathan. Joseph's improper emission of semen led to Benjamin having ten sons named after Joseph instead of the twelve tribes descending from him, as explained in the Talmud. 

|אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י רָחֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֻלַּ֖ד לְיַעֲקֹ֑ב כׇּל־נֶ֖פֶשׁ אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָֽׂר׃|22 P|These were the descendants of Rachel who were born to Jacob—14 persons in all.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 46:22, it is noted that the descendants of Rachel, including Joseph and his two sons, totaled fourteen people. Ibn Ezra explains Leviticus 20:6 as referring to cutting off those who turn to ghosts, comparing it to punishment for giving seed to Molech, using the term "nefashim" as seen in examples like Ezekiel 20:13 and Genesis 46:22. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Rachel bore fourteen children to Jacob, as mentioned in Genesis 46:22. 

|וּבְנֵי־דָ֖ן חֻשִֽׁים׃|23 P|Dan’s son:  Hushim.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests Dan may have had two sons, one possibly dying; Radak explains "sons" may indicate only one son; Steinsaltz notes Hushim referred to in plural due to numerous descendants; Chizkuni proposes Dan had two sons, one unnamed. Midrash discusses significance of multiple names in Bible, tribes of Judah and Dan in construction of Tabernacle and Temple, and various biblical figures. Musar teaches exiles of Jewish people are ultimately for their benefit, descendants of Dan will play significant role in battles preceding arrival of Messiah. Quoting commentary provides insights on genealogy and various biblical figures. Talmud debates interpretation of "sons" referring to single son or large number of descendants. Tanakh lists descendants of Dan by clans, mentioning Shuhamites. Targum Jonathan describes descendants of Dan as skilled warriors and traders. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י נַפְתָּלִ֑י יַחְצְאֵ֥ל וְגוּנִ֖י וְיֵ֥צֶר וְשִׁלֵּֽם׃|24 P|Naphtali’s sons: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Naphtali are listed as Yahtze'el, Guni, Yetzer, and Shilem, skilled weavers and idol breakers, reflecting their actions and inclinations towards idolatry and devotion to God. The names of the sons of Naphtali remained unchanged, reflecting their complete inclination towards God. Zerach, counted as Tzochar, means "illumination", and the family of Ohad became extinct. The stored grain from Egypt was distributed as indicated in Genesis 46:24. The sons of Naphtali were Jakzeel, Guni, Jetser, and Shillem according to both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 46:24. 

|אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י בִלְהָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥ן לָבָ֖ן לְרָחֵ֣ל בִּתּ֑וֹ וַתֵּ֧לֶד אֶת־אֵ֛לֶּה לְיַעֲקֹ֖ב כׇּל־נֶ֥פֶשׁ שִׁבְעָֽה׃|25 P|These were the descendants of Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel. These she bore to Jacob—7 persons in all.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Bilha and Zilpa, given to Rachel and Leah by Laban, respectively, were seven in total, half the number of their descendants. The genealogy of Naphtali in I Chronicles praises Bilhah for willingly marrying Jacob, highlighting her positive qualities. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 46:25 state that Bilhah's sons were given to Rachel by Laban and that she bore seven souls to Jacob. 

|כׇּל־הַ֠נֶּ֠פֶשׁ הַבָּאָ֨ה לְיַעֲקֹ֤ב מִצְרַ֙יְמָה֙ יֹצְאֵ֣י יְרֵכ֔וֹ מִלְּבַ֖ד נְשֵׁ֣י בְנֵי־יַעֲקֹ֑ב כׇּל־נֶ֖פֶשׁ שִׁשִּׁ֥ים וָשֵֽׁשׁ׃|26 P|All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt  —his own issue, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons—all these persons numbered 66.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the count of 66 people who went to Egypt with Jacob, excluding Joseph and his sons, as well as Yocheved. Different commentaries provide interpretations of the count, with some emphasizing the significance of the tribe of Levi and the unity of the Jewish people. Specific individuals, such as Bilhah and Levi's descendants, are highlighted in the text. The inclusion or exclusion of certain individuals leads to discrepancies in the total count of people. 

|וּבְנֵ֥י יוֹסֵ֛ף אֲשֶׁר־יֻלַּד־ל֥וֹ בְמִצְרַ֖יִם נֶ֣פֶשׁ שְׁנָ֑יִם כׇּל־הַנֶּ֧פֶשׁ לְבֵֽית־יַעֲקֹ֛ב הַבָּ֥אָה מִצְרַ֖יְמָה שִׁבְעִֽים׃|27 P|And Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two in number. Thus the total of Jacob’s household who came to Egypt was seventy persons. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Yaakov representing glory and the soul, emphasizing unity within the Jewish nation. Commentary debates the count of 70 individuals from Yaakov's family entering Egypt, with spiritual significance discussed. Kabbalah highlights seeking God's word and righteousness, while Midrash focuses on the counting of the tribe of Levi and the wisdom of Serah. Musar stresses the interconnectedness of all Jews and the importance of loving one another. Quoting Commentary connects Exodus to Genesis, discussing the discrepancy in the number of Yaakov's family members entering Egypt. Talmud resolves the discrepancy by suggesting a twin sister was born with Dinah or Benjamin. Tanakh and Targum mention the seventy persons from Jacob's descendants entering Egypt, with additional details about Jochebed and the increase of the Israelites. 

|וְאֶת־יְהוּדָ֞ה שָׁלַ֤ח לְפָנָיו֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף לְהוֹרֹ֥ת לְפָנָ֖יו גֹּ֑שְׁנָה וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ אַ֥רְצָה גֹּֽשֶׁן׃|28 J|He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to point the way before him to Goshen. So when they came to the region of Goshen,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov sent Yehuda ahead to Goshen to establish a Torah academy and prepare living quarters, symbolizing reconciliation between the brothers and ensuring spiritual needs were met before physical ones (Chasidut, Commentary, Musar). Yehuda's leadership in Egypt and preparations for resettlement parallel historical patterns of leadership succession, with Egyptians aiming to prevent Torah study and commandment performance to distance the Israelites from God (Quoting Commentary). In the Talmud, lineage, marriage practices, and offspring are discussed, with a mention of Shaḥaraim possibly marrying Ruth the Moabite after divorcing his Benjaminite wives (Halakhah, Talmud). The Targum states that Yaakov sent Yehuda ahead to prepare a place for the family in Goshen (Targum). 

|וַיֶּאְסֹ֤ר יוֹסֵף֙ מֶרְכַּבְתּ֔וֹ וַיַּ֛עַל לִקְרַֽאת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל אָבִ֖יו גֹּ֑שְׁנָה וַיֵּרָ֣א אֵלָ֗יו וַיִּפֹּל֙ עַל־צַוָּארָ֔יו וַיֵּ֥בְךְּ עַל־צַוָּארָ֖יו עֽוֹד׃|29 J|Joseph ordered  his chariot and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel; he presented himself to him and, embracing him around the neck, he wept on his neck a good while.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's meeting with his father Jacob symbolizes his righteousness and control over all to draw towards God, contrasting with Jacob's deep connection to God and Joseph's hidden nature. Joseph's rulership in Egypt prepared for exile, reflecting man's role to rule over nature with humility. Joseph's reunion with Jacob was emotionally charged, with Jacob not recognizing him at first due to his royal attire. Joseph's actions towards his father were seen as culturally inappropriate, but he was absolved from reciting the Shema due to honoring Jacob. The lack of pathos in Moses and Aaron's reunion reflects a calm relationship, contrasting with emotional reunions in Genesis. Jacob did not kiss Joseph when they met due to suspicions of moral impurity, confirmed by the Holy Spirit. Pharaoh ordered his chariot and army to accompany him. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף אָמ֣וּתָה הַפָּ֑עַם אַחֲרֵי֙ רְאוֹתִ֣י אֶת־פָּנֶ֔יךָ כִּ֥י עוֹדְךָ֖ חָֽי׃|30 J|Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now I can die, having seen for myself that you are still alive.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob was relieved to see Joseph alive, allowing him to die in peace without facing two deaths as he previously feared. The reunion brought Jacob a sense of fulfillment, highlighting Joseph's importance in the family. The Torah emphasizes Joseph's righteousness and spiritual unity with his brothers, despite his mistreatment and different life experiences. Jacob's words to Joseph are seen as a message against succumbing to the temptations of prosperity in the Second Temple commentary. Israel finds comfort in knowing he can die as the righteous do after reuniting with Joseph in the Targum. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יוֹסֵ֤ף אֶל־אֶחָיו֙ וְאֶל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֔יו אֶעֱלֶ֖ה וְאַגִּ֣ידָה לְפַרְעֹ֑ה וְאֹֽמְרָ֣ה אֵלָ֔יו אַחַ֧י וּבֵית־אָבִ֛י אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּאֶֽרֶץ־כְּנַ֖עַן בָּ֥אוּ אֵלָֽי׃|31 J|Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph ensured his family's integrity by declining Pharaoh's offer for his brothers to participate in Egyptian political life and instructing them to say they were shepherds to avoid offending Pharaoh, as Egyptians disliked shepherds. He then mentioned going to Pharaoh to inform him about his family's arrival from Canaan [Targum]. 

|וְהָאֲנָשִׁים֙ רֹ֣עֵי צֹ֔אן כִּֽי־אַנְשֵׁ֥י מִקְנֶ֖ה הָי֑וּ וְצֹאנָ֧ם וּבְקָרָ֛ם וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָהֶ֖ם הֵבִֽיאוּ׃|32 J|They happen to be shepherds; they have always been breeders of livestock, and they have brought with them their flocks and herds and all that is theirs.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph presented his brothers to Pharaoh as wealthy shepherds skilled in raising sheep and cattle, highlighting their self-employment and success in livestock farming. The Targum translations of Genesis 46:32 further emphasize their expertise in caring for animals and bringing their possessions with them. 

|וְהָיָ֕ה כִּֽי־יִקְרָ֥א לָכֶ֖ם פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְאָמַ֖ר מַה־מַּעֲשֵׂיכֶֽם׃|33 J|So when Pharaoh summons you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Egypt, occupation was crucial for identity, with Egyptians avoiding Jews' professions to protect them from assimilation. Pharaoh's question about the Jews' occupation aimed to maintain their distinctiveness. The text compares humans to cattle-rearers, reflecting power dynamics and reluctance to admit subordination. Targum translations of Pharaoh's question in Genesis 46:33 emphasize the focus on work. 

|וַאֲמַרְתֶּ֗ם אַנְשֵׁ֨י מִקְנֶ֜ה הָי֤וּ עֲבָדֶ֙יךָ֙ מִנְּעוּרֵ֣ינוּ וְעַד־עַ֔תָּה גַּם־אֲנַ֖חְנוּ גַּם־אֲבֹתֵ֑ינוּ בַּעֲב֗וּר תֵּשְׁבוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ גֹּ֔שֶׁן כִּֽי־תוֹעֲבַ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם כׇּל־רֹ֥עֵה צֹֽאן׃|34 J|you shall answer, ‘Your servants have been breeders of livestock from the start until now, both we and our fathers’—so that you may stay in the region of Goshen. For all shepherds are abhorrent to Egyptians.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Egyptians viewed shepherds as an abomination due to their religious beliefs and aversion to killing animals. The Torah's command to sacrifice animals was meant to counter false principles and demonstrate God's superiority over Egyptian deities. The division between Israelite and Egyptian cattle during the plague in Egypt prevented the spread of pestilence. The rejection of shepherds by the Egyptians and the sacrifice of virtues as offerings are symbolic of the conflict between virtue and passion. The Targum translations of Genesis 46:34 emphasize the Israelites' suitability to settle in Goshen as livestock owners from a young age, highlighting the Egyptians' disdain for shepherds. 

## Genesis 47

|וַיָּבֹ֣א יוֹסֵף֮ וַיַּגֵּ֣ד לְפַרְעֹה֒ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אָבִ֨י וְאַחַ֜י וְצֹאנָ֤ם וּבְקָרָם֙ וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר לָהֶ֔ם בָּ֖אוּ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וְהִנָּ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן׃|1 J|Then Joseph came and reported to Pharaoh, saying, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that is theirs, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the region of Goshen.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that Goshen includes Rameses as a subdivision within it, Or HaChaim interprets Joseph's promise to Pharaoh as securing grazing land in Goshen for his family's cattle, Rav Hirsch suggests Joseph presented his family to Pharaoh first to avoid Jacob bowing before him, and Steinsaltz speculates that Egypt may have had a regulation for shepherds to dwell in Goshen, which Joseph reported to Pharaoh upon his family's arrival. In the Targum, Joseph informs Pharaoh that his father, brothers, livestock, and possessions have arrived in Goshen from Canaan. 

|וּמִקְצֵ֣ה אֶחָ֔יו לָקַ֖ח חֲמִשָּׁ֣ה אֲנָשִׁ֑ים וַיַּצִּגֵ֖ם לִפְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה׃|2 J|And carefully selecting a few  of his brothers, he presented them to Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph strategically selected five of his brothers, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Benjamin, and Issachar, to present to Pharaoh to avoid them being drafted into the Egyptian army, as they were considered weaker. The Midrash explains that the selection was based on their names being repeated in Moses's blessing, with Judah, Naphtali, Asher, Dan, Zebulun, and Gad being considered mighty and not presented. Ramban clarifies the term "mikeitz" in Deuteronomy 15:1, while Rashi and Chizkuni discuss the strength of the tribes Zebulun, Gad, Dan, Naphtali, and Asher. In the Talmud, Rava questions Rabba bar Mari about the weak brothers presented to Pharaoh, identified as Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali. Moses blesses Zebulun and Issachar in the Tanakh, encouraging them to find joy in their travels and contentment in their homes. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Joseph presented five brothers to Pharaoh, specifically Zebulon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֛ה אֶל־אֶחָ֖יו מַה־מַּעֲשֵׂיכֶ֑ם וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֗ה רֹעֵ֥ה צֹאן֙ עֲבָדֶ֔יךָ גַּם־אֲנַ֖חְנוּ גַּם־אֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ׃|3 J|Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They answered Pharaoh, “We your servants are shepherds, as were also our fathers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the concept of "ELDaD and MeIDaD" as a source of bounty, completing the Name Elohim with the letter heh (Likutei Moharan 97:1:2). The Torah demonstrates interchangeability of letters with the use of ה instead of י in רעה (Rabbeinu Bahya), and Joseph's brothers distinguish themselves as shepherds, not cattle breeders, as advised by Joseph (Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz). The second tithe in Jerusalem promotes charity to strengthen love and brotherhood, while the law concerning first-born animals includes only domestic animals for practicality (Jewish Thought). Radak interprets רובה in Genesis 21:20:4 as lad or shooter, Rabbeinu Bahya clarifies Yaakov's instructions to gather stones in Genesis 31:46:1, and Ramban explains Yaakov's respectful address to Laban's brothers (Quoting Commentary). In the Second Temple period, Jacob's sons resist the temptations of Pharaoh in Egypt and proudly declare their identity as shepherds when questioned (Second Temple). Pharaoh inquires about Joseph's brothers' occupation, to which they respond that they are shepherds like their fathers (Targum Onkelos Genesis 47:3). 

|וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֗ה לָג֣וּר בָּאָ֘רֶץ֮ בָּ֒אנוּ֒ כִּי־אֵ֣ין מִרְעֶ֗ה לַצֹּאן֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַעֲבָדֶ֔יךָ כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָרָעָ֖ב בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וְעַתָּ֛ה יֵֽשְׁבוּ־נָ֥א עֲבָדֶ֖יךָ בְּאֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן׃|4 J|We have come,” they told Pharaoh, “to sojourn in this land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, the famine being severe in the land of Canaan. Pray, then, let your servants stay in the region of Goshen.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers sought temporary refuge in Goshen due to severe famine in Canaan, emphasizing the divine intervention that has consistently saved the Jewish people throughout history. The parallel events in the lives of Abraham and his descendants underscore the continuity of the Jewish people, as seen in their shared experiences of famine and descent to Egypt. The Pesach Haggadah highlights the fulfillment of God's prophecy in the Israelites' descent into Egypt, while Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, and other commentators discuss the patriarchs' temporary residence in foreign lands and the importance of seeing themselves as temporary residents in Egypt. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף לֵאמֹ֑ר אָבִ֥יךָ וְאַחֶ֖יךָ בָּ֥אוּ אֵלֶֽיךָ׃|5 J|Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “As regards your father and your brothers who have come to you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh told Joseph that his family had arrived, giving him permission to invite them to settle in Egypt under his authority and Pharaoh's approval. Jacob requested to settle in Goshen to avoid assimilation and because the land technically belonged to his family. The Israelites went to Goshen to care for Pharaoh's flocks, with Pharaoh allowing them to settle there temporarily. 

|אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לְפָנֶ֣יךָ הִ֔וא בְּמֵיטַ֣ב הָאָ֔רֶץ הוֹשֵׁ֥ב אֶת־אָבִ֖יךָ וְאֶת־אַחֶ֑יךָ יֵשְׁבוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ גֹּ֔שֶׁן וְאִם־יָדַ֗עְתָּ וְיֶשׁ־בָּם֙ אַנְשֵׁי־חַ֔יִל וְשַׂמְתָּ֛ם שָׂרֵ֥י מִקְנֶ֖ה עַל־אֲשֶׁר־לִֽי׃|6 J|the land of Egypt is open before you: settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land; let them stay in the region of Goshen. And if you know some men of ability  among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 47:6, various commentators interpret the appointment of rulers over livestock in Egypt, with Ibn Ezra suggesting they were in charge of horses and mules, Rashbam and Or HaChaim emphasizing their capabilities in tending to livestock, and Rashi and Siftei Chakhamim highlighting their skill in tending sheep. The Midrash discusses the significance of God revealing Himself from a thorn bush to Moses, emphasizing the symbol of God's presence and compassion for Israel. TABC Talmidim suggest Yosef's strategic decisions to prevent mass hatred and the Maggid's interpretation clarifies Jacob's family's intentions in Egypt. The Talmud discusses the vegetables to be used for Passover in Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim and the respect due to Torah scholars in Berakhot. In Targum, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention settling Jacob's family in the best part of Egypt and appointing capable men as livestock officers. 

|וַיָּבֵ֤א יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־יַֽעֲקֹ֣ב אָבִ֔יו וַיַּֽעֲמִדֵ֖הוּ לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת־פַּרְעֹֽה׃|7 E|Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh; and Jacob greeted Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's reputation as an interpreter of dreams remained intact despite the unfulfilled prediction of the seven years of famine, as he left room for God to change the outcome. Jacob's blessing of Pharaoh and the Nile rising reflects the impact of the righteous on their surroundings, with Jacob's response to Pharaoh's question about his age emphasizing divine protection and the importance of praising God in difficult times. Jacob's family intended to reside temporarily in Egypt due to the famine, not to settle permanently, as clarified by Zevach Pesach, convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֑ב כַּמָּ֕ה יְמֵ֖י שְׁנֵ֥י חַיֶּֽיךָ׃|8 E|Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How many are the years of your life?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh was amazed by Yaakov's age, prompting him to inquire about it. Yaakov explained that his troubled life had aged him, leading to G-d shortening his lifespan by 33 years for complaining to Pharaoh. The Midrash suggests that Yaakov's reduced lifespan was due to not appreciating all that G-d had done for him. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה יְמֵי֙ שְׁנֵ֣י מְגוּרַ֔י שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת שָׁנָ֑ה מְעַ֣ט וְרָעִ֗ים הָיוּ֙ יְמֵי֙ שְׁנֵ֣י חַיַּ֔י וְלֹ֣א הִשִּׂ֗יגוּ אֶת־יְמֵי֙ שְׁנֵי֙ חַיֵּ֣י אֲבֹתַ֔י בִּימֵ֖י מְגוּרֵיהֶֽם׃|9 E|And Jacob answered Pharaoh, “The years of my sojourn [on earth] are one hundred and thirty. Few and hard have been the years of my life, nor do they come up to the life spans of my ancestors  during their sojourns.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob, at 130 years old, considers his life short and full of hardship compared to his ancestors, attributing his aged appearance to the troubles he endured. Ramban links Jacob and David to the moon for their humility and hardships, elevating the righteous above celestial beings. Midrash discusses the judgment of the wicked in Gehinnom, symbolizing Jacob and Joseph with silver offerings and Manasseh with gold, while exploring mourning, ingratitude, and fragrant plants in the Garden of Eden. Quoting Commentary reflects on Simeon and Levi's actions, the lifespans of early generations, Jacob's joy in the afterlife, and the bitterness of human life. Second Temple and Targum highlight Jacob's statement to Pharaoh about his few and troubled years compared to his ancestors. 

|וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֑ה וַיֵּצֵ֖א מִלִּפְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה׃|10 E|Then Jacob bade Pharaoh farewell, and left Pharaoh’s presence.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov blessed Pharaoh with a promise of prosperity by the rising of the Nile, which was seen as valuable due to his age. The blessing was a formality when taking leave of royalty, showing respect. God's blessings on Israel are connected to His presence among His people, as seen in the blessings at the Tabernacle's erection and the encounter with Pharaoh. Rashi explains that the word "blessing" means salutation in Old French, similar to the greeting Yaakov gave Pharaoh. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos both state that Yaakov blessed Pharaoh before departing. 

|וַיּוֹשֵׁ֣ב יוֹסֵף֮ אֶת־אָבִ֣יו וְאֶת־אֶחָיו֒ וַיִּתֵּ֨ן לָהֶ֤ם אֲחֻזָּה֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם בְּמֵיטַ֥ב הָאָ֖רֶץ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ רַעְמְסֵ֑ס כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה פַרְעֹֽה׃|11 J|So Joseph settled his father and his brothers, giving them holdings in the choicest part of the land of Egypt, in the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt in Goshen near Raamses, giving them possession of houses, vineyards, and fields in the best part of the land. The Israelites left the district of Raamses, traveling a distance of 120 mil in a moment to settle in the country of Pelusim as full citizens with Pharaoh's permission. 

|וַיְכַלְכֵּ֤ל יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־אָבִ֣יו וְאֶת־אֶחָ֔יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יו לֶ֖חֶם לְפִ֥י הַטָּֽף׃|12 J|Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father’s household with bread, down to the little ones.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan 2:4:5, Yosef's prayers led to Yaakov granting him the rights of the firstborn, emphasizing the importance of prayer. Joseph distributed rations to his family based on need, ensuring everyone's needs were met. Jacob discussed the future of his sons, praising Yehudah and emphasizing Benjamin's importance. Solomon's wisdom surpassed all men, and the Midrash discusses the righteousness of the patriarchs. Joseph provided bread according to the needs of his family, highlighting the importance of not seeking luxuries. Yaakov's descent to Egypt included meetings with God, Yosef, and Pharaoh, emphasizing divine favor and the migration with a list of names totaling seventy. The Gemara clarifies a vow to grow hair like a Nazirite. Yosef provided bread according to the needs of his family. 

|וְלֶ֤חֶם אֵין֙ בְּכׇל־הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָרָעָ֖ב מְאֹ֑ד וַתֵּ֜לַהּ אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ וְאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן מִפְּנֵ֖י הָרָעָֽב׃|13 J|Now there was no bread in all the world, for the famine was very severe; both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The word "va-telah" indicates exhaustion and crazed inhabitants due to a severe famine in Egypt and Canaan, leading to a shortage of bread and people eating inordinate amounts of food, depleting reserves prematurely. People living further away did not come to Egypt for food due to the long journey or less severe famine. 

|וַיְלַקֵּ֣ט יוֹסֵ֗ף אֶת־כׇּל־הַכֶּ֙סֶף֙ הַנִּמְצָ֤א בְאֶֽרֶץ־מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ וּבְאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בַּשֶּׁ֖בֶר אֲשֶׁר־הֵ֣ם שֹׁבְרִ֑ים וַיָּבֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶת־הַכֶּ֖סֶף בֵּ֥יתָה פַרְעֹֽה׃|14 J|Joseph gathered in all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, as payment for the rations that were being procured, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s palace.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's integrity and wisdom are highlighted in how he collected all the money in Egypt during the famine, bringing it to Pharaoh's treasury without keeping any for himself, earning the trust of the people and ensuring the survival of the population. The Midrash texts discuss the prosperity of Eretz Yisrael and Joseph's righteousness, while Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, and Ramban provide insights into Joseph's character and actions. The Talmud and Targum emphasize Joseph's role in collecting and managing resources during the famine. 

|וַיִּתֹּ֣ם הַכֶּ֗סֶף מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֘יִם֮ וּמֵאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֒עַן֒ וַיָּבֹ֩אוּ֩ כׇל־מִצְרַ֨יִם אֶל־יוֹסֵ֤ף לֵאמֹר֙ הָֽבָה־לָּ֣נוּ לֶ֔חֶם וְלָ֥מָּה נָמ֖וּת נֶגְדֶּ֑ךָ כִּ֥י אָפֵ֖ס כָּֽסֶף׃|15 J|And when the money gave out in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, lest we die before your very eyes; for the money is gone!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

During the famine, the money in Egypt and Canaan was exhausted, leading the Egyptians to seek food from Joseph who initially accepted money as payment to impoverish them and elevate his brothers' status. Joseph's knowledge of people's finances allowed him to charge prices accordingly, accepting livestock as payment as the money supply dwindled. The Torah mentions the depletion of money in Canaan to emphasize the dire situation, and some sages believe the famine ended with Yaakov's arrival. Ibn Ezra and Siftei Chakhamim explain the concept of money being brought to naught, showing that only Hashem has the power to save or punish. Targum translations also highlight the lack of money in Egypt and Canaan during the famine. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ הָב֣וּ מִקְנֵיכֶ֔ם וְאֶתְּנָ֥ה לָכֶ֖ם בְּמִקְנֵיכֶ֑ם אִם־אָפֵ֖ס כָּֽסֶף׃|16 J|And Joseph said, “Bring your livestock, and I will sell to you against your livestock, if the money is gone.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the irregular vocalization of the word "give" in Genesis 47:16 and discusses the use of the word "fail" in the same verse. Haamek Davar suggests Joseph tested his brothers by asking for their livestock. Steinsaltz summarizes Joseph's offer to exchange food for livestock when the brothers ran out of silver. Midrash states Joseph selected weaker brothers to present before Pharaoh and asked for livestock when silver ran out. Quoting Ibn Ezra, the word "אפס" in Isaiah 29:20 means to be brought to naught. Targum versions describe Joseph offering to exchange food for livestock when money runs out. 

|וַיָּבִ֣יאוּ אֶת־מִקְנֵיהֶם֮ אֶל־יוֹסֵף֒ וַיִּתֵּ֣ן לָהֶם֩ יוֹסֵ֨ף לֶ֜חֶם בַּסּוּסִ֗ים וּבְמִקְנֵ֥ה הַצֹּ֛אן וּבְמִקְנֵ֥ה הַבָּקָ֖ר וּבַחֲמֹרִ֑ים וַיְנַהֲלֵ֤ם בַּלֶּ֙חֶם֙ בְּכׇל־מִקְנֵהֶ֔ם בַּשָּׁנָ֖ה הַהִֽוא׃|17 J|So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, for the stocks of sheep and cattle, and the asses; thus he provided them with bread that year in exchange for all their livestock.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

During the famine, Joseph distributed food slowly to prevent overeating, following proper conduct. He provided food in exchange for livestock in the sixth year of the famine when money ran out, including horses. Joseph gathered silver from Egypt and other countries, which Israel took when leaving Egypt, and the wealth eventually ended up hidden in Rome. Yoseif exchanged bread for livestock from the people, including horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys, sustaining them during the famine. 

|וַתִּתֹּם֮ הַשָּׁנָ֣ה הַהִוא֒ וַיָּבֹ֨אוּ אֵלָ֜יו בַּשָּׁנָ֣ה הַשֵּׁנִ֗ית וַיֹּ֤אמְרוּ לוֹ֙ לֹֽא־נְכַחֵ֣ד מֵֽאֲדֹנִ֔י כִּ֚י אִם־תַּ֣ם הַכֶּ֔סֶף וּמִקְנֵ֥ה הַבְּהֵמָ֖ה אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֑י לֹ֤א נִשְׁאַר֙ לִפְנֵ֣י אֲדֹנִ֔י בִּלְתִּ֥י אִם־גְּוִיָּתֵ֖נוּ וְאַדְמָתֵֽנוּ׃|18 J|And when that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from my lord that, with all the money and animal stocks consigned to my lord, nothing is left at my lord’s disposal save our persons and our farmland.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's arrival in Egypt brought a blessing that ended the famine, which resumed after his death. Joseph strategically selected less powerful brothers to present before Pharaoh, exposing their wealth. Midrash portrays Jacob as pure and righteous, while Esau is depicted as violent and deceitful. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount the Egyptians offering their bodies and lands to Joseph in exchange for food during the famine. 

|לָ֧מָּה נָמ֣וּת לְעֵינֶ֗יךָ גַּם־אֲנַ֙חְנוּ֙ גַּ֣ם אַדְמָתֵ֔נוּ קְנֵֽה־אֹתָ֥נוּ וְאֶת־אַדְמָתֵ֖נוּ בַּלָּ֑חֶם וְנִֽהְיֶ֞ה אֲנַ֤חְנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵ֙נוּ֙ עֲבָדִ֣ים לְפַרְעֹ֔ה וְתֶן־זֶ֗רַע וְנִֽחְיֶה֙ וְלֹ֣א נָמ֔וּת וְהָאֲדָמָ֖ה לֹ֥א תֵשָֽׁם׃|19 J|Let us not perish before your eyes, both we and our land. Take us and our land in exchange for bread, and we with our land will be serfs to Pharaoh; provide the seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become a waste.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's arrival in Egypt ended the famine, Joseph established a share-cropping system with the Egyptians, Rabbeinu Yonah and Rabbeinu Bahya discuss the significance of Jacob's blessing, Pirkei Avot 2:5 provides advice on character traits, and the Targums describe the Egyptians offering to become slaves to Pharaoh for seed grain. 

|וַיִּ֨קֶן יוֹסֵ֜ף אֶת־כׇּל־אַדְמַ֤ת מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לְפַרְעֹ֔ה כִּֽי־מָכְר֤וּ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ אִ֣ישׁ שָׂדֵ֔הוּ כִּֽי־חָזַ֥ק עֲלֵהֶ֖ם הָרָעָ֑ב וַתְּהִ֥י הָאָ֖רֶץ לְפַרְעֹֽה׃|20 J|So Joseph gained possession of all the farm land of Egypt for Pharaoh, all the Egyptians having sold their fields because the famine was too much for them; thus the land passed over to Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yoseif acquired all the land in Egypt during the famine, making the Egyptians serfs of Pharaoh, similar to how Torah scholars may appear unattractive externally but are filled with knowledge internally. Israel's sins will be atoned for on Yom Kippur, and they will not be subject to the yoke of any creature in the future, overcoming their captors like Joseph who purchased his purchasers (Gen. 47:19-20, Targum Jonathan on Gen. 47:20). 

|וְאֶ֨ת־הָעָ֔ם הֶעֱבִ֥יר אֹת֖וֹ לֶעָרִ֑ים מִקְצֵ֥ה גְבוּל־מִצְרַ֖יִם וְעַד־קָצֵֽהוּ׃|21 J|And he removed the population town by town,  from one end of Egypt’s border to the other.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph uprooted the Egyptians from their cities and transferred them to new locations to prevent uprisings, remind them they were slaves, and prevent them from claiming inheritance of the land. His actions aimed to remove a reproach from his brothers and highlight their status as strangers in the land. This enforced resettlement was seen as a moral refinement process to lead people back to sanctity and the holy covenant with God, symbolizing the importance of Israelites being strangers in other lands. Joseph's love for his brothers was demonstrated by this act, preventing the Egyptians from calling his brothers exiles and ensuring they were settled in different areas to avoid ridicule. 

|רַ֛ק אַדְמַ֥ת הַכֹּהֲנִ֖ים לֹ֣א קָנָ֑ה כִּי֩ חֹ֨ק לַכֹּהֲנִ֜ים מֵאֵ֣ת פַּרְעֹ֗ה וְאָֽכְל֤וּ אֶת־חֻקָּם֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר נָתַ֤ן לָהֶם֙ פַּרְעֹ֔ה עַל־כֵּ֕ן לֹ֥א מָכְר֖וּ אֶת־אַדְמָתָֽם׃|22 J|Only the land of the priests he did not take over, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived off the allotment which Pharaoh had made to them; therefore they did not sell their land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Egypt, the priests were exempt from laws restricting land ownership due to their role as local aristocracy or religious leaders, receiving daily allotments of food from Pharaoh. Rabbi Simlai emphasizes starting prayers with praise to align oneself with God's will, while Kabbalah explains the term Chok as representing HaShem's role as the decisor. Rabbi Tachlipha teaches about Heaven assigning man's necessities, with expenses for Sabbath, festivals, and education exempt. In the Talmud, the term "statute [ḥok]" in relation to food is discussed, and the Targum explains that the priests did not sell their land in Egypt due to their previous help to Pharaoh. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־הָעָ֔ם הֵן֩ קָנִ֨יתִי אֶתְכֶ֥ם הַיּ֛וֹם וְאֶת־אַדְמַתְכֶ֖ם לְפַרְעֹ֑ה הֵֽא־לָכֶ֣ם זֶ֔רַע וּזְרַעְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־הָאֲדָמָֽה׃|23 J|Then Joseph said to the people, “Whereas I have this day acquired you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you to sow the land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the consequences of not following Joseph's instructions during the famine, linking the ability to have children to the concept of "Heh you have seed." The importance of charity, peace, and making one's wife happy in the mitzvah for fertility is emphasized, along with the connection to the concept of tzedek and the source of seed. The acquisition of people and lands for Pharaoh, the use of language in prophecies, the symbolism of patriarchs representing Sefirot, and the purification of seed in Kabbalah are also discussed. Additionally, the word "eychah" in Akeidat Yitzchak is examined in a different context, and the role of David in completing the forefathers is highlighted in the commentary. 

|וְהָיָה֙ בַּתְּבוּאֹ֔ת וּנְתַתֶּ֥ם חֲמִישִׁ֖ית לְפַרְעֹ֑ה וְאַרְבַּ֣ע הַיָּדֹ֡ת יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶם֩ לְזֶ֨רַע הַשָּׂדֶ֧ה וּֽלְאׇכְלְכֶ֛ם וְלַאֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּבָתֵּיכֶ֖ם וְלֶאֱכֹ֥ל לְטַפְּכֶֽם׃|24 J|And when harvest comes, you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths shall be yours as seed for the fields and as food for you and those in your households, and as nourishment for your children.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Kedushat Levi, the comparison between God and the soul is explored through five attributes, with Joseph instructing farmers to give one fifth of their crops to Pharaoh and keep four fifths for themselves, ensuring they have enough food. Pharaoh's dreams were prophetic, leading Joseph to interpret them as a message from God, ultimately saving mankind from famine. The Mishnah discusses the measure for joining Shabbat boundaries, with specific measurements for the size of meals. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the presence of God accompanying the Israelites to Egypt, associated with retribution and lack of pity. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that a fifth of produce must be given to Pharaoh. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ הֶחֱיִתָ֑נוּ נִמְצָא־חֵן֙ בְּעֵינֵ֣י אֲדֹנִ֔י וְהָיִ֥ינוּ עֲבָדִ֖ים לְפַרְעֹֽה׃|25 J|And they said, “You have saved our lives! We are grateful to my lord, and we shall be serfs to Pharaoh.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 47:25, the Israelites referred to themselves as Pharaoh's slaves, indicating they would not have been willing to become Joseph's slaves. Rashi explains that paying the tax annually did not mean they would belong to Pharaoh as slaves, while Or HaChaim suggests that by offering themselves as slaves to Pharaoh, they became owned outright by him. Joseph correctly interpreted Pharaoh's dreams, gaining favor and managing the distribution of grain during the famine, ultimately reuniting with his family in Canaan. The seven years of plenty in Egypt ended perfectly, leading to a severe famine where even coarse bread was sought after. Pharaoh directed the hungry Egyptians to Joseph, who compelled them to circumcise themselves, ensuring their lives in the World to Come. In Genesis 47:25, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Joseph's brothers acknowledge he saved their lives and offer to be slaves to Pharaoh in gratitude. 

|וַיָּ֣שֶׂם אֹתָ֣הּ יוֹסֵ֡ף לְחֹק֩ עַד־הַיּ֨וֹם הַזֶּ֜ה עַל־אַדְמַ֥ת מִצְרַ֛יִם לְפַרְעֹ֖ה לַחֹ֑מֶשׁ רַ֞ק אַדְמַ֤ת הַכֹּֽהֲנִים֙ לְבַדָּ֔ם לֹ֥א הָיְתָ֖ה לְפַרְעֹֽה׃|26 J|And Joseph made it into a land law in Egypt, which is still valid, that a fifth should be Pharaoh’s; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph established a law in Egypt where one-fifth of the land was designated for Pharaoh, with exceptions for the priests who were supported directly by the king. Joseph did not drink wine after being separated from his brothers, and it is suggested that his brothers also abstained from wine without him. Yosef's power is emphasized in rescuing his family and Egypt, leading to the Egyptians serving him. The phrase "to/for Pharaoh" highlights the legal transaction involving Yosef's influence, and he advised collecting a 20% tax during years of plenty. This law was codified to ensure it was not a burden and would remain in place permanently. 

|וַיֵּ֧שֶׁב יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם בְּאֶ֣רֶץ גֹּ֑שֶׁן וַיֵּאָחֲז֣וּ בָ֔הּ וַיִּפְר֥וּ וַיִּרְבּ֖וּ מְאֹֽד׃|27 J P|Thus Israel settled in the country of Egypt, in the region of Goshen; they acquired holdings in it, and were fertile and increased greatly.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The settling of the Israelites in the land of Goshen among the Egyptians allowed them to sublimate Egyptian cultural values while maintaining their identity as Yisrael, as noted in Chasidut. Jacob strategically settled his sons in Goshen to prevent political involvement in Egyptian affairs and minimize their exile, as highlighted in the commentary. Rabbi Soloveitchik observed that the Israelites became comfortable in Egypt despite reminders of their return to the Promised Land, needing to be forced to leave. Kabbalistic interpretations connect the removal of ḥallah from dough to purification and generation of clean seed, paralleling human coupling in Genesis 47:23. Various commentaries discuss the destruction of enemies leading to the return of holiness to the Jewish people, the significance of dwelling in certain places signifying impending calamity, and the prosperity and growth of the Israelites in Goshen as described in Targum.
